Sec. 1382c(a)(1)(B)(ii) (1982) (\"Section (B)(ii)\"), which was enacted in 1972 as part of Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\"Act\").  In pertinent part, that provision (\"the 'color of law' provision\") confers SSI eligibility on aliens who are \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue are orders of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Charles P. Sifton, Judge, which (1) granted in part plaintiffs' motion seeking to have the Secretary held in contempt and to have the decree otherwise enforced, (2) denied the Secretary's motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.  (\"Rule\") 60(b)(5), in which she requested relief from the terms of the decree, (3) provided for an amendment (\"Amendment\") of the decree, and (4) denied the Secretary's motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), in which she challenged the Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, the Secretary argues on this appeal that the Amendment is improper because it exceeds the scope of the underlying statute, and does not comport with the intent of the parties.  The Secretary also argues that the district court exceeded its authority in ordering her to promulgate regulations to implement the consent decree.  In addition, the Secretary contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree because the case is moot with respect to the two beneficiaries named in the decree, and, finally, that the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree with respect to nonparties.  The appellees--plaintiff Manny Berger (\"Berger\") and persons who intervened to enforce the decree--maintain that the district court's actions were proper, and that the orders should be affirmed in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellees that the Secretary's arguments do not warrant reversal of the lower court's orders.  Indeed, we find that the court's actions were, almost without exception, entirely justified in the face of the appellant's demonstrated noncompliance with the terms of the underlying decree.  In connection, however, with the Secretary's challenge to the district court's requirement that she promulgate regulations, we find that the Amendment should be modified to exclude the requirement that language specified by the court be contained in the regulations promulgated.  As so modified, the Amendment, and the other orders of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berger instituted this action in 1976 to challenge the termination of his SSI benefits.  He had come to the United States from Russia in 1948, on a temporary visa.  He overstayed his visa, and in 1967 he voluntarily surrendered to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").  Although Berger was subsequently ordered deported, the travel documents required for his deportation to the Soviet Union could not be obtained by the agency.  In 1975, therefore, the INS placed Berger under an \"order of supervision\" pursuant to section 242(d) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INAct\").  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1252(d) (1982).  In addition, HHS terminated Berger's SSI benefits.  HHS asserted that, because of his alienage status, Berger did not meet the eligibility requirements for the SSI program as set out in section 1382c(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SSI program is designed \"to assure a minimum level of income for people who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled and who do not have sufficient income and resources to maintain a standard of living at the established Federal minimum income level.\"    20 C.F.R. Sec. 416.110 (1984).  The section of the Act at issue provides that in order to receive SSI benefits an individual must be either</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(i) a citizen or (ii) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law (including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. Sec. 1382c(a)(1)(B)(i), (ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's amended complaint, filed in 1977, was in the nature of a class action.  It raised claims on behalf of Berger and the class composed of those aliens permanently residing in the United States under color of law who have been denied SSI benefits solely because the Secretary has determined that they are not in this country under color of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint asserted, inter alia, (1) that Section (B)(ii) \"requires that SSI benefits be granted to all otherwise eligible aliens permanently residing in the United States under color of law, and not just to those who are in this country as a result of the application of 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1153(a)(7) or 1182(d)(5),\" and (2) that the Secretary had erred in denying SSI benefits to Berger and the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in 1977, Emma Mena (\"Mena\"), who is now deceased, moved to intervene in this action.  Mena was diagnosed in 1963 as having cancer.  She first received SSI benefits in 1975.  In 1976, she was informed that her SSI benefits would be discontinued because her alienage status prevented her from meeting the eligibility requirements for the program.  She then notified the agency that an immediate relative immigrant visa petition had been filed on her behalf, and pointed out that INS Operations Instruction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (\"INSOI\") 242.1(a)(24) prohibited her deportation during the pendency of the petition.  When her benefits were not reinstated, she moved to intervene in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1978, the parties and the court signed a five-page consent decree stipulating to the following matters.  First, plaintiff Berger, \"an alien residing in the United States under an order of supervision issued pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1252(d), is an alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law pursuant to [Section (B)(ii) ].\"  Second, proposed intervenor Mena, \"an alien who is the beneficiary of an immediate relative immigrant visa petition and thus has been afforded indefinite voluntary departure by the [INS] pursuant to [INSOI] 242.10(a)(b)(i), is an alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law pursuant to [Section (B)(ii) ] since at least December 1, 1976,\" the month in which Mena's SSI benefits ceased.  Further, p 3 of the consent decree set forth the agreement of the parties regarding the interpretation accorded the \"color of law\" language of Section (B)(ii).  Paragraph 3 provided in full that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aliens who are permanently residing in the United States under color of law and who may be eligible for [SSI] benefits include, but are not limited to:  (1) aliens admitted to the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1153(a)(7);  (2) aliens paroled into the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1182(d)(5);  and (3) aliens residing in the United States pursuant to an order of supervision, indefinite stay of deportation or indefinite voluntary departure.  Any other alien residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the [INS] and whose departure from the United States the [INS] does not contemplate enforcing is also permanently residing in the United States under color of law and may be eligible for [SSI] benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added).  Finally, p 5 of the consent decree provided that the Secretary would \"take all steps necessary to ensure that this order is carried out by the employees of the Social Security Administration....\"  No appeal was taken from this decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Set forth below is a discussion of the motions made below and the district court's disposition of those motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for Contempt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1982, Berger and several intervenors (\"plaintiffs\") moved for an order adjudging the Secretary in contempt for failure to comply with the decree.  At issue on that motion was what action the Secretary was required to take under p 5 of the decree to ensure that the decree would be carried out by the agency's employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Disposition of the Plaintiff's Arguments.    Plaintiffs asserted that the Secretary should be ordered to revise the agency's regulations and internal operating instructions to reflect the terms of p 3, which, as discussed above, interpreted the scope of the \"color of law\" language of Section (B)(ii).  The court found that the Secretary had not adequately publicized the terms of p 3 of the consent decree, and ordered that the Secretary \"take steps to effectuate the terms of the final judgment by promulgating amendments to the Secretary's regulations and operations manuals and agency guidelines stating the Secretary's position [as set forth in p 3].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also sought an order directing the Secretary to specify in the applicable regulations the twenty-two categories of aliens which plaintiff alleged were clearly residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS and whose departure from the United States the INS did not contemplate enforcing.  Instead, the court directed the parties to settle an amended final judgment setting forth fifteen categories of aliens whose members the parties agreed were to be considered permanently residing in the United States under color of law.  Although the court rejected the plaintiffs' request for an order directing the Secretary to list twenty-two categories of aliens in the regulations, the court stated that \"[i]t would best serve the interests of clarity and concreteness and evidence the Secretary's good faith compliance with the judgment if those categories of aliens about which the parties are in agreement were listed in the final judgment and published to agency personnel and applicants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Disposition of the Secretary's Arguments.    In opposition to the motion, the Secretary first argued that the scope of p 3 should be limited--based on her reading of Holley v. Lavine, 553 F.2d 845 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied sub nom.  Shang v. Holley, 435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1532, 55 L.Ed.2d 545 (1978)--so that only those aliens who have received a letter from the Department of Justice stating that the INS does not contemplate enforcing his or her departure from the United States would be deemed to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law.  The district court rejected this argument on the ground that the plain meaning of p 3 precluded the Secretary's proposed reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also argued that the policy set forth in the decree--that aliens are to be considered permanently residing in the United States under color of law if they are here with the knowledge and permission of the INS and the INS does not contemplate enforcing their departure--had already been made clear in existing regulations.  The court rejected this argument, concluding that existing regulations and internal operating instructions suggested that the \"under color of law\" provision had a much narrower scope than that set forth in p 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court noted that the Secretary had advised the court that it was her position that the language of p 3 might cover some categories of aliens who did not qualify under the statute as permanent residents under color of law.  The court stated that the Secretary should pursue this argument by moving for relief from the judgment, rather than by refusing to carry out its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary subsequently moved under Rule 60(b)(5) for relief from the decree on the theory that certain portions of it were ultra vires and that, therefore, it would be inequitable for those portions to have prospective application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary argued that the legislative history of Section (B)(ii) indicated that the only aliens Congress intended to make eligible for SSI pursuant to the \"color of law\" language were political refugees and aliens who entered the country prior to July 1948.  The Secretary also contended that certain language in p 3 of the decree was confusing and inaccurate under current immigration law and procedure.  In a written opinion, the court rejected both of the Secretary's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court's ruling on the Rule 60(b) motion, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed final judgment.  The Secretary filed papers in opposition to this proposed modification, and--without relinquishing her right to challenge the substance of the court's construction of the decree--presented her own proposed amended final judgment.  In July 1984, the court signed an order which amended the decree largely, although by no means entirely, in accordance with the plaintiffs' proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Rule 59(e) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary then moved for a rehearing pursuant to Rule 59(e) on the grounds that (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree because the action was moot as to Berger and because the court could not grant relief to nonparties, and (2) the court lacked the power to order the Secretary to promulgate regulations and internal operating instructions.  The court rejected both of these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary then took this appeal from the district court's four orders, challenging the substance of the Amendment and its jurisdictional underpinnings.  We granted a stay of the district court's orders pending the outcome of the appeal.DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>I. The Court's Jurisdiction to Enforce the Decree</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's jurisdictional contentions are without merit.  First, she objects that the decree cannot be enforced because the action itself is moot;  second, she objects that the court's Amendment requires enforcement of the decree with respect to persons who are not parties to the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's first contention is that the action must be dismissed for mootness.  She argues that the action is moot because Berger--the only named beneficiary still alive<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>--is receiving the SSI benefits he sought in bringing the action.  She further argues that no one else is entitled to enforce the decree.  In the latter connection, she asserts that persons cannot intervene under Rule 71 to enforce the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Secretary's approach, the heart of the decree--p 3--would have been unenforceable at the moment it came into existence.  In other words, the Secretary would like to have it both ways:  she wants the litigation against her to be concluded based on her agreement--sanctioned by the court--to adopt a given interpretation of a statutory provision and yet, by providing those specifically named in the decree with benefits, she also wants to prevent the court from requiring her to implement this interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several reasons, we reject the Secretary's approach.  We find that the action was not moot as to Berger, and that the persons participating in the enforcement action were entitled to do so under Rule 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Secretary argues that since Berger is being provided SSI benefits under the decree, he is already receiving all the relief he sought in his action, and that the case is therefore moot as to him.  The Secretary, however, misstates the issue.  The consent decree entered in this action stipulated that Berger was eligible for SSI benefits, and that he would continue to receive benefits as long as his alienage status continued to make him eligible.  Berger asserted that the Secretary was not complying with the decree, and instituted contempt proceedings to enforce the decree.  The real question, therefore, is whether, in the face of the Secretary's alleged non-compliance, Berger was entitled to ensure, by means of proceedings to enforce the decree, that he continued to receive benefits, or whether he was precluded from so doing because he had not yet lost those benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   Thus, the issue is not--as the Secretary contends--whether the action is moot because Berger is currently receiving benefits.  Rather, the issue is the ripeness of his claim of noncompliance, i.e., whether the challenged conduct was sufficiently threatening to Berger to justify his invocation of the court's jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is axiomatic that the judicial power conferred by Art. III may not be exercised unless the plaintiff shows 'that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.' \"   Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 2783, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982) (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979)).  The Yaretsky Court, however, emphasized that \"[o]f course, '[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.'   Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 593 [43 S.Ct. 658, 663, 67 L.Ed. 1117] (1923), quoted in Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 [99 S.Ct. 2301, 2308, 60 L.Ed.2d 895] (1979).  '[T]he question becomes whether any perceived threat to respondents is sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy....' \"  Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1000, 102 S.Ct. at 2784 (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 496, 94 S.Ct. 669, 676, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Yaretsky, petitioners, who were administrators of state agencies, asserted that the Court was without jurisdiction to hear objections by respondents, who were nursing home residents, to certain types of transfers between facilities.  Petitioners argued that respondents had obtained complete relief under the consent judgment previously entered in the action, and that since the petitioners themselves had not been threatened with the type of transfer now challenged, they were without standing to object to those transfers.  The Court rejected petitioners' argument.  In determining that it had jurisdiction to hear respondents' claims, the Court reasoned that \"the nursing homes in which respondents reside remain free to determine ... that respondents' continued stay at current levels of care is not medically necessary.  The possibility that they will do so is not 'imaginary or speculative.' \"    Id. (quoting Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42, 91 S.Ct. 746, 749, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971)).  The Court also noted that \"[i]n light of similar determinations made by the committee of physicians chosen by the facilities to make such assessments, the threat is quite realistic.\"    Id. 457 U.S. at 1000-01, 102 S.Ct. at 2784.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the contempt motion was based on evidence of the Secretary's repeated failure to carry out the terms of p 3 of the decree.  This failure posed a threat to all those SSI recipients and applicants whose eligibility depended on the \"color of law\" provision.  A party's noncompliance with certain aspects of a decree is a powerful indication that the party may not feel bound to honor other aspects.   See Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1000-01, 102 S.Ct. at 2783-84 (citing O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 496, 94 S.Ct. at 676 (\"[P]ast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.\")).  In support of the motion for contempt, the court was presented with documents concerning various individuals who had been improperly denied benefits under the \"color of law\" provision.  The fact that Berger's benefits had not been terminated is of no moment;  under the circumstances, it was not necessary for Berger to wait for the axe to fall on him also before he brought suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree provides Berger with benefits only \"as long as his immigration status remains that of an alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law....\"  Under this language, his continued receipt of benefits remains dependent upon the Secretary's interpretation of the \"color of law\" provision, and, specifically, on her implementation of the interpretation set forth in p 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Her alleged noncompliance with p 3 was therefore a significant threat to Berger's interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   Thus, we agree with the district court that the Secretary's failure to properly educate agency staff regarding the eligibility standard under p 3 of the decree posed a threat to Berger that was sufficiently real and immediate to amount to an existing controversy entitling him to enforce the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Furthermore, under a second line of reasoning, we believe that basic contract principles supported Berger's right to move for enforcement of the decree.  The decree is a contract embodying promises made to Berger by the Secretary in exchange for the termination of his action.   See Dotson v. United States Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., 731 F.2d 313, 318 (6th Cir.1984) (\"A consent decree ... is ... a contract that has been negotiated by the parties....\");  see also United States v. Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971).  Berger brought suit on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.  Although no class was certified, the Secretary agreed in the decree (1) to provide benefits to the named beneficiaries, and (2) to adopt and apply the interpretation of the \"color of law\" provision set forth in p 3.  The promise incorporated in p 3 was made to Berger, as promisee.  Berger could therefore challenge noncompliance with p 3 and sue to enforce the promise it contained.  Moreover, to the extent that he was suing on behalf of third parties benefited by the decree, he was supported by state contract law, since in New York a promisee for the benefit of third parties may enforce the promise on behalf of the third parties.   See In re Spong, 661 F.2d 6, 10 (2d Cir.1981);  In re O.P.M. Leasing Servs., 21 B.R. 993, 1005 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1982);  City of New York v. Smith, 279 F.Supp. 866, 869 (S.D.N.Y.1968);  see also Owens v. Haas, 601 F.2d 1242, 1250 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  County of Nassau v. Owens, 444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 483, 62 L.Ed.2d 407 (1979) (considering New York law regarding third party beneficiaries in discussion of contract governed by federal law);  cf. Rule 17(a) (\"a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made for the benefit of another ... may sue in his own name....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, this is not a situation in which the plaintiff in an individual action has passed out of the original condition which gave him standing.   See Lasky v. Quinlan, 558 F.2d 1133, 1136 (2d Cir.1977) (individual plaintiffs who sought to enforce compliance with a consent decree regarding jail conditions could not do so after they had been released from the jail;  they no longer had an \"interest in the enforcement of the decree\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>   Berger continues to have the same interest in the decree as he had when it was entered into, and the same interest in the suit as he had when it was instituted.  He remains a recipient of SSI and is dependent, for the receipt of benefits, on his eligibility pursuant to the \"color of law\" provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, even if Berger had not shown sufficient threat of injury with respect to his own receipt of benefits, he was entitled to come into court to complain of noncompliance as it affected third parties because the Secretary's promise to benefit third parties was included in a valid contract with him.    That is to say, Berger had already been injured by the fact that the Secretary had failed to carry out all of the promises she made to him on behalf of third parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The individuals who sought, under Rule 71 to join in Berger's contempt motion have the right to enforce the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>   Rule 71 provides in pertinent part:  \"When an order is made in favor of a person who is not a party to the action, he may enforce obedience to the order by the same process as if he were a party....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the intervenors properly sought to enforce obedience to a prior order made in their favor.  The consent decree is conceded to provide benefits to non-parties.  By its terms, the decree provides for a particular construction of the SSI eligibility provision, which construction benefits innumerable applicants who will be entitled to SSI pursuant to the decree.  As a practical matter, of course, it would not have been possible to name these past, present and future applicants in the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is substantial authority for the proposition that \"a consent decree is not enforceable directly or in collateral proceedings by those who are not parties to it even though they were intended to be benefited by it,\" Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 750, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1932, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) (citations omitted), we think that this authority was not intended to preclude nonparties from intervening to enforce a consent decree where otherwise authorized by the federal rules of civil procedure.   See United States v. American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 564 n. 6 (2d Cir.1983), cert. denied sub nom.  American Cyanamid Co. v. Melamine Chemicals, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 1596, 80 L.Ed.2d 127 (1984) (court found that the rule against enforcement of consent decrees by third parties did not apply under the circumstances since, as an intervenor under Rule 24(b), company would be barred from relitigating issues under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lasky v. Quinlan, supra, a case in which no class was certified, a contempt proceeding to enforce a consent decree providing for improvements in the county jail was instituted by the original plaintiffs who were no longer in custody in that jail.  The court found the action moot as to the original plaintiffs, and rejected the contention that Rule 71 provided a basis on which the original plaintiffs could enforce the decree.  The court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>It seems clear that Rule 71 was intended to assure that process be made available to enforce court orders in favor of and against persons who are properly affected by them, even if they are not parties to the action....  While Rule 71 may support a separate action by a present inmate to enforce the order obtained by the plaintiffs, it cannot be used by a party to enforce an order in an action in which he no longer has standing to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">558 F.2d at 1137.    Lasky effectively gave persons who were not original parties a green light to pursue enforcement of the consent decree at issue.   Cf. In re Spong, 661 F.2d at 10 (\"In a third party beneficiary contract, benefits flow to both the promisee and the third party, and either may sue to enforce the contract.\"    Id. (citing New York cases));  Owens v. Haas, 601 F.2d at 1250-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary contends that while this language might permit a putative class member to bring a separate action, it does not permit intervention by such persons in a proceeding instituted by a named plaintiff, and thus does not support participation by the intervenors in this case.  It is clear, however, that the Secretary misreads this language.  Of course, where, as here, plaintiff himself is able to pursue enforcement by means of a contempt proceeding, judicial economy virtually requires that appropriate persons be permitted to intervene under Rule 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Benefits to Nonparties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's second contention is that the court was without jurisdiction to enter the Amendment because it confers benefits on nonparties.  The Secretary points to the fact that no class was certified in this action, and argues that the power of the court does not extend to the granting of relief to any persons other than those named in the decree, since they were the only parties properly before the court.  Although the Secretary concedes that the original decree provided for relief to nonparties, she nevertheless asserts that this problem has only now become clear because \"the district court has ordered injunctive relief in favor of nonparties to effectuate its interpretation of the original consent judgment.\"    The Secretary's argument must be rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed a class complaint.  The consent decree was entered, however, prior to certification of a class, as the preamble to the decree specifically acknowledged.  When the Secretary raised the absence of class certification on her Rule 59(e) motion below, the plaintiffs made a motion for class certification.  The district court ruled that certification was unnecessary, and the motion, untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of class certification is not problematic in this case, and does not affect the enforceability of the Amendment or of the decree itself.  We agree with the court below that certification of a class was not necessary here since the decree's prospective \"relief will benefit all members of a proposed class to such an extent that the certification of a class would not further the implementation of the judgment.\"   Davis v. Smith, 607 F.2d 535, 540 (1978), recalled and remanded on other grounds, 607 F.2d 540 (2d Cir.1979);  Galvan v. Levine, 490 F.2d 1255, 1261 (2d Cir.1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 936, 94 S.Ct. 2652, 41 L.Ed.2d 240 (1974);  Feld v. Berger, 424 F.Supp. 1356, 1363 (S.D.N.Y.1976);  see also Lasky v. Quinlan, 558 F.2d at 1135;  Note, Administrative Agency Intracircuit Nonacquiescence, 85 Colum.L.Rev. 582, 596 &amp; n. 96 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Feld v. Berger, the court found that class certification would be \"superfluous\" where four plaintiffs, residents of nursing homes, sought injunctive and declaratory relief against certain practices and regulations of defendant administrators on the ground that they violated due process principles and applicable federal regulations.  The court reasoned,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>The defendants are public officials charged with compliance with and enforcement of federal as well as state laws.  The Court assumes these public officials, mindful of their responsibilities, will apply the determination here made equally to all persons similarly situated.  \"[I]t would be unthinkable that the ... defendants would insist on other actions being brought\" to vindicate the same rights at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">424 F.Supp. at 1363 (footnote omitted) (quoting Vulcan Soc'y v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 490 F.2d 387, 399 (2d Cir.1973)).  Similarly, in Galvan v. Levine, a district court's refusal to certify a class was upheld where the defendant had \"made clear that it underst[ood] the judgment to bind it with respect to all claimants.\"    490 F.2d at 1261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, it is undisputed that the Secretary agreed, in signing the decree, to confer certain benefits on nonparties.  It is clear to this court that, in so doing, she also agreed to the enforcement of the decree in favor of nonparties.  Therefore, as in the above-cited cases, certification of a class was unnecessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Secretary had objections to the interpretation as set forth in the consent decree, she could have refused to sign the decree in 1978, or challenged the decree on direct appeal.  The judgment contained a stipulated interpretation of a statutory provision.  It is simply untenable for her to contend at this juncture that because she disagrees with the interpretation in the decree she will not be bound by it except as it affects persons within the Eastern District of New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary cites cases to the effect that injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.   See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2558, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979).  Such cases are not, however, governing where, as here, the defendant consented to the relief provided.  Furthermore, the Secretary's position is in direct conflict with her own regulations which provide for nationwide uniformity in eligibility standards for the SSI program.  20 C.F.R. Sec. 416.110(d) (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of her argument on this issue, the Secretary also cites cases pertaining to preliminary injunctive relief;  they, too, are inapposite here.  They stand for the proposition that because the preliminary injunction is designed \"to preserve the status quo during litigation to determine the merits of the case,\" Hollon v. Mathis Indep. School Dist., 491 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir.1974) (per curiam), preliminary injunctive relief granted in the absence of class certification \"may properly cover only the named plaintiffs.\"   National Center for Immigrants Rights v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 743 F.2d 1365, 1371 (9th Cir.1984);  Hollon, 491 F.2d at 93.  Since there has been a final judgment disposing of this action on the consent of the parties, the constraints applicable upon the granting of preliminary extraordinary relief have no relevance here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Consent Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously discussed, the consent decree was amended by the district court after it had ruled, on a contempt motion, that the Secretary had failed to comply with certain of its central terms.  The procedural and substantive history of this case is a complex illustration of the dynamic interaction between the courts and litigants pursuant to the entry of a consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent decrees are a hybrid in the sense that they are at once both contracts and orders, see United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 236 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 926, 934 n. 10, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975);  they are construed largely as contracts, but are enforced as orders.   See Schurr v. Austin Galleries, 719 F.2d 571, 574 (2d Cir.1983);  American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d at 563-64.  It is recognized that a consent decree represents a compromise between parties who have waived their right to litigation and, in the interest of avoiding the risk and expense of suit, have \"give[n] up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation....  For these reasons, the scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners, and not by reference to what might satisfy the purposes of one of the parties to it.\"   United States v. Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. at 681-82, 91 S.Ct. at 1757;  see also Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 2576, 2586, 81 L.Ed.2d 483 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court is not entitled to expand or contract the agreement of the parties as set forth in the consent decree, see Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 303 F.2d 283, 284 (2d Cir.1962) (per curiam), and the explicit language of the decree is given great weight.   See Vertex Distributing, Inc. v. Falcon Foam Plastics, Inc., 689 F.2d 885, 892-93 (9th Cir.1982).  By the same token, deference is to be paid to the plain meaning of the language of a decree and the normal usage of the terms selected.   See United States v. Atlantic Refining Co., 360 U.S. 19, 22-23, 79 S.Ct. 944, 946, 3 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1959).  Nevertheless,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since a consent decree or order is to be construed for enforcement purposes basically as a contract, reliance upon certain aids to construction is proper, as with any other contract.  Such aids include the circumstances surrounding the formation of the consent order, any technical meaning words used may have had to the parties, and any other documents expressly incorporated in the decree.  Such reliance does not in any way depart from the \"four corners\" rule of Armour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935 (footnote omitted);  see American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d at 563.

Comm'r of the Mass. Dep't of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d 790, 797-98 (1st Cir.1982).  In enforcing its orders, a district court may take such steps as are appropriate given the resistance of the noncompliant party.   See Madden v.

Those provisions to which plaintiffs have referred ... limit the categories of aliens who may be eligible for SSI benefits as permanently residing in the United States under color of law to aliens admitted as refugees, aliens paroled indefinitely, aliens granted indefinite stays of deportation or voluntary departure for an indefinite period by the INS or the courts, and aliens granted asylum by the Attorney General.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court directed the Secretary to take steps to effectuate the terms of the final judgment by promulgating amendments to the agency's regulations, operations manuals and guidelines to reflect the Secretary's position as stated in p 3 of the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   In addition, the court ordered the parties to settle an amended final judgment clarifying p 3 of the original decree by setting forth some of the categories of aliens which were within the ambit of the standard set forth therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amendment ultimately entered by the court did not meet with the approval of the Secretary.  She now challenges the Amendment principally on the ground that it is ultra vires because it conflicts with Section (B)(ii).  She also argues that the Amendment is ultra vires because it goes beyond the scope of the original decree.  Finally, she argues that if the district court's broad reading of the original decree is proper, then the original decree is ultra vires because it conflicts with the underlying statute, and is therefore unenforceable as written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Underlying Statute:  Section (B)(ii)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary contends that the Amendment is in conflict with the SSI statute because it confers eligibility on certain aliens who are not accorded eligibility by Section (B)(ii), if that provision is interpreted in light of its legislative history.  She argues that the because of this conflict between the Amendment and the statute, the Amendment cannot stand under the Supreme Court's opinions in System Fed'n No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 81 S.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961), and Firefighters Union No. 1784 v.

We find her citations to the legislative history unconvincing in their own right and in the face of the language of the statutory provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our starting place in determining the intended meaning of a statutory provision is, of course, the language of the statute.   See Belland v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 726 F.2d 839 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 245, 83 L.Ed.2d 183 (1984).  However, the fact that the statutory language--and its plain meaning--are the starting place for construing a statute \"does not 'preclude consideration of persuasive evidence [of differing legislative intent] if it exists.' \"    March v. United States, 506 F.2d 1306, 1313 (D.C.Cir.1974) (footnote omitted) (quoting Boston Sand and Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U.S. 41, 48, 49 S.Ct. 52, 54, 73 L.Ed. 170 (1928)).  Indeed, where the scope of a statutory provision is not made crystal clear by the language of the provision, it is appropriate to turn to the legislative history of the statute.   See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 570, 89 S.Ct. 817, 834, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969);  Schwartz v. Romnes, 495 F.2d 844, 849 (2d Cir.1974).  Further, legislative history may be consulted in order to ascertain \"whether literal application of the statute would 'pervert its manifest purpose.' \"   See United States v. Perdue Farms, Inc., 680 F.2d 277, 280 (2d Cir.1982) (quoting In re Adamo, 619 F.2d 216, 222 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Williams v. New York State Higher Educ.

Statutory Language</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of the phrase in question--\"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\"--is not clear from the language employed.  Instead, the phrase is designed to be adaptable and to be interpreted over time in accordance with experience, developments in the law, and the like.  In this sense the phrase is organic and fluid, rather than prescriptive or formulaic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree wholeheartedly with the district court's characterization of the phrase as \"both expansive and elastic.\"    As Judge Sifton observed, \"On its face, by its reference to 'under color of law,' the language [of Section (B)(ii) ] invites dynamic interpretation by both courts and the administrative agency charged with the statute's enforcement to determine the statute's application in particular cases in the light of developments in the country's immigration policy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Holley v. Lavine, 553 F.2d 845 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied sub nom.  Shang v. Holley, 435 U.S. 947, 98 S.Ct. 1532, 55 L.Ed.2d 545 (1978), the court construed the phrase \"under color of law\" in a virtually identical regulatory provision regarding the Aid to Families with Dependant Children (\"AFDC\") program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   The court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>The phrase [\"under color of law\"] obviously includes actions not covered by specific authorizations of law.  It embraces not only situations within the body of the law, but also others enfolded by a colorable imitation.  \"Under color of law\" means that which an official does by virtue of power, as well as what he does by virtue of right.  The phrase encircles the law, its shadows, and its penumbra.  When an administrative agency or a legislative body uses the phrase \"under color of law\" it deliberately sanctions the inclusion of cases that are, in strict terms, outside the law but are near the border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">553 F.2d at 849-50.  The Secretary's narrow interpretation of this language is thus clearly inconsistent with the expansive approach previously taken in this circuit--an approach we consider well-taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"permanently residing,\" which appears in Section (B)(ii), should also be read in accordance with our reasoning in Holley regarding that phrase.  There, the court stated that these words should be read in light of the INAct, which provides:  \"The term 'permanent' means a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the United States or of the individual, in accordance with law.\"    8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(31) (1982);  see Holley, 553 F.2d at 850-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the \"color of law\" language in the AFDC regulations discussed in Holley, the \"color of law\" language in Section (B)(ii) is modified by a parenthetical, and the effect of the parenthetical on the meaning of the phrase as a whole must be considered.  The phrase in the SSI statute reads as follows:  \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law (including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8).\"    As will be discussed below, section 1153(a)(7) provides for the conditional entry of certain aliens, and section 1182(d)(5) provides that the Attorney General may temporarily parole aliens into the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a common sense interpretation, the categories of aliens listed in the parenthetical are illustrative rather than definitive.  Although the parenthetical specifies two statutory provisions which entitle an alien to classification as a permanent resident under color of law, it does not thereby limit such classification to those who fall under those two provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This common sense interpretation has been codified.  Congress specifically provided, in the definitions applicable to the SSI statute, that the term \" 'including' when used in a definition ... shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\"    42 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(b) (1982);  see Holley, 533 F.2d at 851 (Section 1301(b) \"is a legislative caution to lean more on the 'ejusdem generis' than on the 'inclusio unius, exclusio alterius' cannon of construction.\").  Certainly, in light of this codification, the statutory provisions listed should be viewed as examples--members of a series whose scope is not delineated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot find any support in the language of Section (B)(ii) for the Secretary's limited interpretation of that provision.  She argues that Congress intended the \"color of law\" provision to confer eligibility on only two groups of aliens:  those who entered the country as refugees, and those who entered the country prior to June 30, 1948.  The language does not, however, say what the Secretary argues it means.    The language does not indicate that eligibility is limited to the two categories urged by the Secretary;  indeed, neither of these categories is referred to explicitly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the parenthetical appears on its face to undermine the Secretary's position.  The parenthetical lists two provisions, section 1153(a)(7) and section 1182(d)(5).  The first, section 1153(a)(7), provides for conditional entry, and addresses the entry of refugees in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>   The second, section 1182(d)(5), is more general;  it permits the Attorney General to temporarily parole, for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest, any alien applying for admission to the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   Indeed, the Secretary, while explaining that the provision is used to allow entry to refugees, does not dispute that the provision is not limited to this purpose.  Nor does she contend that it is used solely for this purpose.  Thus, we find that the parenthetical weighs heavily against the Secretary's interpretation of Section (B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we find that the restrictive interpretation urged by the Secretary does not comport with the provision on its face, we are not adverse to examining the extrinsic materials presented by the Secretary in support of her position.  The intended scope of a statutory provision may be clarified by pertinent legislative history and administrative practice.  \"[W]here a word or phrase is reasonably capable of more than one meaning, we have repeatedly affirmed the wisdom of looking to the entire text of the statute and to its legislative history in order to ascertain, if possible, the intent of the drafters and true scope and meaning of the term.\"   Schwartz v. Romnes, 495 F.2d at 849 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Finance Report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary first argues that the language in a Senate Finance Committee report shows that the language \"permanent resident under color of law\" was \"clearly intended to apply only to aliens who entered the United States before July, 1948.\"    She points to a discussion of a proposed change in the AFDC eligibility provisions.  The proposal was contained in H.R. 1, which also contained the SSI provisions, and evidently would have added the phrase \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" to the AFDC statute.  She cites the following language from the report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>Under the committee bill ..., States would be mandated in Federal law to require as a condition of eligibility for the AFDC welfare program ... that an individual be a resident of the United States and either a citizen or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or a person who is a permanent resident under color of law (that is, a person who entered the United States before July 1948 and who may be eligible for admission for permanent residence at the discretion of the Attorney General under section 1259 of title 8 of the United States Code).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 1230, 92nd Congress, 2nd Sess. 466 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the language discussed in this excerpt incorporated in the SSI statute without modification, the Secretary's argument might carry some weight in our analysis.  However, since this language was not enacted in the form discussed in the report, we are left entirely unpersuaded.  As previously indicated, the \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" language of Section (B)(ii) is modified by a parenthetical--\"(including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8)\".  This parenthetical not only patently broadens the meaning of the phrase beyond the interpretation contained in the Senate report, but also effectively contradicts the particular limitation the report advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Floor Amendment &amp; Sponsors' Remarks</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parenthetical grew out of two Senate floor amendments sponsored by Senators Chiles and Gurney of Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   The Secretary argues that the Chiles-Gurney amendments, which included \"color of law\" language, were \"intended simply to insure that Cuban refugees would be entitled to SSI,\" and that the \"color of law\" provision should be given an accordingly limited interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the amendments added the language \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" to the SSI eligibility provisions.  The other added a general definition of that language which was made expressly applicable throughout the various provisions of the Act amended by the bill.  This definition provided that \"the term 'alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law' shall include an alien refugee who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section [1153(a)(7) ] or section [1182(d)(5) ] of [Title 8].\"  The Senate approved the amendments by voice vote.  When H.R. 1 was reported out of the House Conference Committee, however, it contained the language of the parenthetical as ultimately enacted, rather than the Chiles-Gurney language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary cites the following remarks of Senator Chiles:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>[The amendments] simply make clear in the bill that it would not detract from the rights to benefits of Cuban refugees, of which 12,000 reside in Florida.  They are receiving benefits presently under the existing system [of state-administered federal categorical grants], but there has been some question as to whether, under this bill, they would be eligible.  These amendments would make it clear that they are eligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">118 Cong.Rec. 33959 (1972).  She also cites the following remarks of Senator Gurney:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>[T]hese amendments which we are introducing at this time are designed to prevent a great and unintended economic hardship being placed upon the people of Dade County, Fla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know that the Finance Committee and its distinguished chairman did not intend this result, however, the effect of the limiting language concerning aliens which appears ... on page 466 of the [Senate Finance C]ommittee report does just that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  It is the Secretary's argument that these remarks indicate that the amendments as proposed and the language as enacted were intended to restrict the meaning of the \"color of law\" language to cover only refugees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is--at most--a very slender reed on which to hang the Secretary's request that we find the Amendment at issue in conflict with the underlying statute.  Contemporaneous remarks of a sponsor of legislation are by no means controlling in the analysis of legislative history.   Weinberger v. Rossi, 456 U.S. 25, 35 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1510, 1517 n. 15, 71 L.Ed.2d 715 (1982).  More to the point, such remarks are of little or no import where, as here, the legislature has subsequently included other language--albeit similar--in the law as enacted.  To permit clear statutory language to be materially altered by the remarks of the Senate sponsors before the bill achieved final form \"would open the door to the inadvertent, or perhaps even planned, undermining of the language actually voted on by Congress and signed into law by the President.\"   Regan v. Wald, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 3036, 82 L.Ed.2d 171 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming that the two Senators from Florida intended the \"color of law\" definition to limit the eligible aliens to refugees, the language of their own amendments stated otherwise.  Their language provided that the phrase should be interpreted to \"include an alien refugee [who is here pursuant to section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8].\"  (Emphasis added).  As discussed supra, the word \"include\" is not restrictive;  it precedes an example of the members of a group.  The fact that the language of the amendment identified refugees as members of the group of aliens permanently residing in the United States \"under color of law\" does not indicate that aliens who are not refugees are necessarily excluded from that group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that the Secretary's arguments regarding the legislative history of Section (B)(ii) are without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>   Based on our examination of the language of the provision and our review of its legislative history, we find that the phrase, \"under color of law,\" is designed to be an open vessel--to be given substance by experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>   We agree with the district court's conclusion that the \"color of law\" provision is inherently elastic, and we reject the Secretary's restrictive interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Paragraph 3 of the Consent Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also argues that the Amendment goes beyond the scope of the original decree by conferring SSI eligibility on aliens who were not eligible under the original p 3 as correctly construed.  She contends that terms agreed to in the original decree do not support the extension of benefits to the class covered by the Amendment.  As discussed below, we find that this argument is based on an incorrectly narrow interpretation of the decree which must be rejected.  The Secretary also argues that if the consent decree is not accorded the narrow interpretation she urges, then the decree itself is ultra vires because it exceeds the scope of the statute.  We reject this argument as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 3 of the original decree lists several categories of aliens who will be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law, and provides that any other alien residing in the United States \"with the knowledge and permission\" of the INS, whose departure the INS \"does not contemplate enforcing,\" is also permanently residing in the United States under color of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that this language is properly interpreted to cover only those aliens as to whom there has been an official determination or authorization, embodied in a letter, that the alien is legitimately present in the country for an indefinite period of time.  Although she concedes that the \"knowledge and permission\" language of the paragraph \"permit[s] a much broader reading,\" she argues that \"the government never contemplated such a ... reading.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary bases her argument in part on the well-established principle that a consent decree may be interpreted in light of \"the circumstances surrounding the ... order.\"   United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935.  She asserts that in this instance the decree originated out of, and should therefore be limited to, the facts presented by Berger and Mena, the two beneficiaries named in the decree.  This argument has no merit whatsoever.  Paragraph 3 is so written as to make untenable any limitation of its scope to the particular facts presented by the parties named in the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also relies on the maxim that a decree must be interpreted in light of the \"technical meaning words used may have had to the parties.\"    Id.  She contends that \"[t]he limited holding of Holley ... is obviously the 'technical meaning' \" of the words used in the consent decree here, and that under Holley the broad language of p 3 should be given the limitation she proposes, that is, that an official letter be a prerequisite to SSI eligibility under the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Holley, decided during the year before the consent decree was entered, the court determined that where an applicant for AFDC benefits is an alien parent who has official assurance that she will not be deported at least until her children are no longer dependent upon her, the parent is \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" and is thus eligible for AFDC under the governing regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   The court indicated that it considered plaintiff to be a member of a \"minuscule sub-class of aliens who, although unlawfully residing in the United States, are each individually covered by a letter ... stating that the [INS] 'does not contemplate enforcing ... [the alien's] departure from the United States at this time.' \"   Holley, 553 F.2d at 849.  Far more significant for the purposes of our analysis here, however, is the fact that the court found it appropriate to give an expansive interpretation to the phrase \"under color of law,\" and to adopt an interpretation of the phrase \"permanently residing\" in which the conception of \"permanent\" more closely resembled \"lasting\" or \"enduring,\" than \"forever.\"    We therefore find that, on balance, the decision in Holley cuts against the Secretary's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, although Holley involved an alien who had received a letter stating that no action to deport her was contemplated, we find no indication in the language of the decree before us that the receipt of such a letter is a prerequisite to \"color of law\" status.  While p 3 echoes the language of the letter in Holley--that is, the phrase, \"does not contemplate enforcing, etc.\"--the glaring absence of any mention in the decree that a letter to this effect would be required is fatal to the Secretary's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government's contemporaneous interpretation of Holley lends support to an expansive view of the consent decree, rather than a restrictive one.  The petition for certiorari in Holley--which was denied just four months before the decree was filed--was opposed by the United States, as amicus on behalf of respondent Holley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>   In its amicus brief, the government argued that the phrase \"residing under color of law\" includes those aliens whose residence in the United States is \"continued by virtue of official permission or acquiescence.\"    (Emphasis added).  The government also observed that the INAct provisions listed in the parenthetical--8 U.S.C. Secs. 1153(a)(7) and Sec. 1182(d)(5)--were merely \"illustrative examples,\" and further stated that they \"obviously forbid any narrow reading\" of the word \"permanently.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, viewed in the context in which it was drawn up, see ITT Continental Baking, 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935;  United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 665 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083, 102 S.Ct. 638, 70 L.Ed.2d 617 (1981), the consent decree appears to have been entered into by the parties with the expectation that the language of p 3 would be construed expansively, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary must be rejected.  We agree with the district court that \"the plain meaning of [p ] 3 ... clearly goes beyond [her] limited interpretation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>   Furthermore, based on our analysis of the legislative history of Section (B)(ii), supra, we find no reason to believe that such an expansive reading of p 3 brings the decree into conflict with the underlying statute.  We therefore reject the Secretary's argument to that effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Paragraph 3 under the Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected the Secretary's arguments under the statute and the original decree, we turn briefly to the challenged Amendment to confirm that it comports with our conclusions regarding the underlying statute.  We are satisfied that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amendment provides, in pertinent part, that p 3 of the consent judgment filed on June 13, 1978, is modified to include the language set out in the margin (\"amended p 3\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>   Amended p 3 essentially reiterates the language of the original p 3, and then sets out a non-exclusive list of eleven categories of aliens falling within the \"color of law\" provision.  Finally, it states the circumstances under which an alien will be considered \"as one whose departure the INS does not contemplate enforcing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the Secretary's specific challenges to the Amendment on the grounds set out in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and note that we find the Amendment otherwise in conformity with both the letter and the spirit of the underlying statute and the original decree.  In particular, the concept of permanence incorporated in Section (B)(ii) is in no way slighted in the decree or the Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>   Rather, both the decree and the Amendment reinforce the \"permanently residing\" language of the statutory provision.  Both are, of course, to be read in light of the approach to permanence taken in Holley.    There, the court gave great weight to the INAct's definition of permanence, and observed that the INAct provisions in the parenthetical in Section (B)(ii) are \"instances where the alien is permitted to stay in the United States not necessarily forever, but only so long as he is in a particular condition.\"    553 F.2d at 851.  The provisions of the Amendment are written so that they may be executed in accordance with the same standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Requiring the Issuance of Regulations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also contends that the district court lacked the power to order her to promulgate regulations implementing the provisions of p 3 as amended.  We find that the court acted within its authority in so doing.  We believe, however, that the court overstepped its authority when it required that certain language be contained in the regulations.  We therefore affirm the district court's action with the proviso that the order must be modified to exclude the requirement, set out in p 4, that specified language appear in the regulations issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary asserts, citing 42 U.S.C. Secs. 405(a), 1383(d)(1) (1982), that \"[p]rescription of final regulations ... usurps the Secretary's statutory grant of authority to promulgate regulations,\" see also 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1302 (1982), and that requiring their promulgation is therefore not a remedy the court has the power to provide.  Plaintiffs assert that, pursuant to a finding of noncompliance by the Secretary, the court was empowered to direct her to promulgate regulations in accordance with the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before us is whether the Secretary may continue to operate under regulations which do not comport with a judgment of the court entered upon consent of the parties.  In reaching our conclusion that the district court's directive to promulgate regulations was proper under the circumstances, we are particularly persuaded by three considerations:  (1) the Secretary had already promulgated regulations regarding SSI eligibility prior to the court's order;  (2) the district court had found that the Secretary was not in compliance with the original decree;  and (3) the Secretary had given her consent to the terms of the original decree.  We address these factors below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Secretary has already chosen to promulgate regulations on the very issue of SSI eligibility which is before us.  See supra note 20.  Further, she has revised these regulations since the entry of the consent decree.  Indeed, the fact that the regulations promulgated subsequent to the decree did not comport with the decree indicates that the court was, in effect, forced to order that further regulations be promulgated to ensure compliance with the terms of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the balance between the powers of the court and the powers of the executive is not at issue here.  This is not an occasion in which the Secretary had chosen to refrain from taking any action.   See Heckler v. Chaney, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1651-52, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (agency refused to take certain investigatory and enforcement actions).  Nor is this a situation in which the Secretary had already decided against proceeding by rulemaking, in favor of proceeding by another means.   Cf. Pressley v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 437 F.2d 716, 721-22 (D.C.Cir.1970) (court urged, but did not require, the agency to formulate regulations instead of proceeding solely by individual adjudication);  see generally Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Comm'n, 606 F.2d 1031, 1055-56 (D.C.Cir.1979) (traditionally, agency rather than court determines whether to proceed by means of rulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination).  Nor is it a situation in which the Secretary had pursued rulemaking proceedings, but ultimately determined that a final rule should not be adopted.   WWHT, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 656 F.2d 807, 818-19 (D.C.Cir.1981) (agency denied a rulemaking petition after it had terminated rulemaking proceedings on the same matter without adopting a rule).  Nor, finally, is it a situation in which the Secretary asserts that rulemaking proceedings on this issue would be administratively infeasible or inappropriate, or would consume an inordinate amount of time or agency resources.   Cf. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 606 F.2d at 1045-46 (discussing various pragmatic considerations weighing against judicial review of agency's decision not to adopt regulations regarding a given activity);  see generally Garland, Deregulation and Judicial Review, 98 Harv.L.Rev. 507, 562-68 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the failure of the Secretary to promulgate appropriate regulations was part and parcel of a failure to effectuate the substantive terms of p 3 of the decree, as well as a failure to comply with the procedural terms of p 5 of the decree.  Paragraph 5 of the decree is reasonably interpreted to require the promulgation of appropriate regulations.  When the court found that the Secretary had failed to otherwise effectuate the eligibility standard incorporated in p 3, the court was authorized to require her to issue regulations to effectuate that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under its power to take reasonable steps to enforce its orders, see, e.g., Class v. Norton, supra, the court was entitled to require that the Secretary promulgate regulations so as to come into compliance with the decree.  Further, the plaintiffs who had bargained for the terms of the decree, and agreed to cease litigating on the basis of the decree were entitled to have the decree enforced as written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ordering the promulgation of regulations, the district court asked no more than that the Secretary \"meet its responsibilities by adopting a fair ... rule within a reasonable period of time.\"   British Airways Bd. v. Port Auth., 564 F.2d 1002, 1013 (2d Cir.1977).  \"The law simply will not tolerate the denial of rights by unwarranted official inaction.\"   Id. at 1010.  Thus, the Secretary has merely been required to redraft her regulations to bring them into conformity with a court order to which she has consented.   Cf. Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 752 F.2d 694, 726 (D.C.Cir.1985) (agency ordered to redraft regulations to bring them into conformity with statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that the Secretary gave her consent to the original judgment is of considerable significance in evaluating her argument that the court does not have the power to require her to promulgate regulations.   Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117, 1127-28 (D.C.Cir.1983), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 2668, 81 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984).  The judgment in this case, entered on consent, was itself an agreement by the Secretary to do certain acts.  Having given her consent to terms which are understood to include the promulgation of regulations, she cannot now object to the terms as if they had been imposed upon her against her will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gorsuch, the appellate court considered the argument that, in approving a consent decree, the district court had impermissibly limited the agency's discretion to determine the procedures and criteria it would use in preparing to promulgate regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act.  The court observed at the outset that the issue of \"infringement of agency discretion [which] ... normally arises in the context of a judicial order disposing of a case on its merits ... is framed somewhat differently here because the Decree was entered with [the agency's ] consent.\"    Id. (footnote omitted).  Because the consent decree in Gorsuch was largely the work of the agency and the other parties to the litigation rather than the work of the district court, the appellate court concluded that \"the requirements imposed by the Decree do not represent judicial intrusion into the Agency's affairs to the same extent they would if the Decree were 'a creature of judicial cloth.' \"    Id. (quoting Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Hawaii/Peace Educ. Project, 454 U.S. 139, 141, 102 S.Ct. 197, 200, 70 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not err in ordering the promulgation of regulations, the court's requirement that the Secretary include the language of p 3 as amended in her regulations intruded unnecessarily into the administrative sphere.   See Federal Power Comm'n v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 20, 73 S.Ct. 85, 86, 97 L.Ed. 15 (1952) (the lower court intruded on an administrative function in ordering the agency to strike an unlawful section of a license).  Therefore, while we uphold the district court's requirement that the Secretary promulgate regulations which are in accordance with the decree, we find that the requirement that specified language be included in the regulations must be deleted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The orders appealed from are affirmed, except insofar as the Amendment to the decree requires the Secretary to incorporate specified language in the regulations promulgated in accordance with that Amendment.  The action is remanded so that the Amendment may be modified to exclude the latter requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> HHS was formerly, and at the time this action was instituted, called the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

Sec. 416.1600(c) and Sec. 416.1618(b).

Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3531.12, at 50.  Standing asks whether an alleged injury is adequate to justify judicial consideration.  Ripeness and mootness both assume \"that an asserted injury would be adequate;  ripeness then asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen,\" id., and mootness asks \"whether the occasion for judicial intervention persists.\"   Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205 n. 10, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).  Thus, in this case, where a threatened injury is at issue, the proper line of inquiry pertains to ripeness:  \"whether the harm asserted has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.\"   Id. at 499 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. at 2205 n. 10</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, looking at the case as it has developed to date, see Blanchette v. Connecticut Gen. Ins. Corp., 419 U.S. 102, 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, 356, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974), it appears that the Secretary's position regarding the decree is a direct threat to Berger's continued receipt of benefits.  Berger did not enter this country as a refugee and did not arrive prior to July 1948.  Thus, Berger's eligibility for SSI would be in jeopardy if the court were persuaded by the Secretary's argument that SSI eligibility pursuant to the \"color of law\" provision is limited to refugees and persons who entered the United States prior to July 1948</p>\n        <p>The Secretary's observation--in a footnote unrelated to her mootness claim--that Berger's particular circumstances gave him \"the effective equivalent of refugee status,\" and her representation that she does not intend to terminate Berger's benefits do not eliminate the threat posed to Berger by the Secretary's failure to comply with the decree.  She has presented him with no affidavit setting forth these assurances.  In any event, he would remain dependent upon her compliance for continued receipt of benefits, and she might at any time resolve that he does not meet the \"color of law\" standard.   Cf.

She agrees to the following three categories:  those who were admitted as refugees, those who have been residents since before July 1948, and those granted political asylum.  These groups are listed as categories (e), (i) and (d) in amended p 3</p>\n        <p>Of the eight other categories listed, four appear to be challenged on the ground that they do not comport with the \"permanently residing\" requirement of Section (B)(ii), since they would, inter alia, confer SSI eligibility on mere applicants for various types of relief or review.  See (a), (b), (c), (j).  This argument is not persuasive since the categories are, in all four instances, limited to those aliens \"whose departure the INS does not contemplate enforcing.\"    The latter qualification satisfactorily reflects and enforces the \"permanently residing\" requirement of the statute.  Of course, any applicants otherwise falling within the categories listed would also have to meet this qualification.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary challenges three other categories on the ground that, although they were covered by the original decree, \"the legislative history of the SSI statute indicates that [some or all of the aliens in these categories] are not entitled to SSI.\"    See (g), (h), (k).  Since we have already rejected the Secretary's arguments based on legislative history, we need not concern outselves further with these challenges.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary's final challenge is based on her assertion that the immigration status listed in (f) \"has little if any meaning\" under current usage, and that it is virtually never given for indefinite periods of time.

Sec. 1382c(a)(1)(B)(ii) (1982) (\"Section (B)(ii)\"), which was enacted in 1972 as part of Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\"Act\").  In pertinent part, that provision (\"the 'color of law' provision\") confers SSI eligibility on aliens who are \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue are orders of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Charles P. Sifton, Judge, which (1) granted in part plaintiffs' motion seeking to have the Secretary held in contempt and to have the decree otherwise enforced, (2) denied the Secretary's motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.  (\"Rule\") 60(b)(5), in which she requested relief from the terms of the decree, (3) provided for an amendment (\"Amendment\") of the decree, and (4) denied the Secretary's motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), in which she challenged the Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, the Secretary argues on this appeal that the Amendment is improper because it exceeds the scope of the underlying statute, and does not comport with the intent of the parties.  The Secretary also argues that the district court exceeded its authority in ordering her to promulgate regulations to implement the consent decree.  In addition, the Secretary contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree because the case is moot with respect to the two beneficiaries named in the decree, and, finally, that the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree with respect to nonparties.  The appellees--plaintiff Manny Berger (\"Berger\") and persons who intervened to enforce the decree--maintain that the district court's actions were proper, and that the orders should be affirmed in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellees that the Secretary's arguments do not warrant reversal of the lower court's orders.  Indeed, we find that the court's actions were, almost without exception, entirely justified in the face of the appellant's demonstrated noncompliance with the terms of the underlying decree.  In connection, however, with the Secretary's challenge to the district court's requirement that she promulgate regulations, we find that the Amendment should be modified to exclude the requirement that language specified by the court be contained in the regulations promulgated.  As so modified, the Amendment, and the other orders of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berger instituted this action in 1976 to challenge the termination of his SSI benefits.  He had come to the United States from Russia in 1948, on a temporary visa.  He overstayed his visa, and in 1967 he voluntarily surrendered to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\").  Although Berger was subsequently ordered deported, the travel documents required for his deportation to the Soviet Union could not be obtained by the agency.  In 1975, therefore, the INS placed Berger under an \"order of supervision\" pursuant to section 242(d) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INAct\").  8 U.S.C. Sec. 1252(d) (1982).  In addition, HHS terminated Berger's SSI benefits.  HHS asserted that, because of his alienage status, Berger did not meet the eligibility requirements for the SSI program as set out in section 1382c(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SSI program is designed \"to assure a minimum level of income for people who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled and who do not have sufficient income and resources to maintain a standard of living at the established Federal minimum income level.\"    20 C.F.R.

It raised claims on behalf of Berger and the class composed of those aliens permanently residing in the United States under color of law who have been denied SSI benefits solely because the Secretary has determined that they are not in this country under color of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint asserted, inter alia, (1) that Section (B)(ii) \"requires that SSI benefits be granted to all otherwise eligible aliens permanently residing in the United States under color of law, and not just to those who are in this country as a result of the application of 8 U.S.C. Secs. 1153(a)(7) or 1182(d)(5),\" and (2) that the Secretary had erred in denying SSI benefits to Berger and the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in 1977, Emma Mena (\"Mena\"), who is now deceased, moved to intervene in this action.  Mena was diagnosed in 1963 as having cancer.  She first received SSI benefits in 1975.  In 1976, she was informed that her SSI benefits would be discontinued because her alienage status prevented her from meeting the eligibility requirements for the program.  She then notified the agency that an immediate relative immigrant visa petition had been filed on her behalf, and pointed out that INS Operations Instruction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (\"INSOI\") 242.1(a)(24) prohibited her deportation during the pendency of the petition.

At issue on that motion was what action the Secretary was required to take under p 5 of the decree to ensure that the decree would be carried out by the agency's employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Disposition of the Plaintiff's Arguments.    Plaintiffs asserted that the Secretary should be ordered to revise the agency's regulations and internal operating instructions to reflect the terms of p 3, which, as discussed above, interpreted the scope of the \"color of law\" language of Section (B)(ii).  The court found that the Secretary had not adequately publicized the terms of p 3 of the consent decree, and ordered that the Secretary \"take steps to effectuate the terms of the final judgment by promulgating amendments to the Secretary's regulations and operations manuals and agency guidelines stating the Secretary's position [as set forth in p 3].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also sought an order directing the Secretary to specify in the applicable regulations the twenty-two categories of aliens which plaintiff alleged were clearly residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS and whose departure from the United States the INS did not contemplate enforcing.  Instead, the court directed the parties to settle an amended final judgment setting forth fifteen categories of aliens whose members the parties agreed were to be considered permanently residing in the United States under color of law.  Although the court rejected the plaintiffs' request for an order directing the Secretary to list twenty-two categories of aliens in the regulations, the court stated that \"[i]t would best serve the interests of clarity and concreteness and evidence the Secretary's good faith compliance with the judgment if those categories of aliens about which the parties are in agreement were listed in the final judgment and published to agency personnel and applicants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Disposition of the Secretary's Arguments.    In opposition to the motion, the Secretary first argued that the scope of p 3 should be limited--based on her reading of Holley v. Lavine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344877\"><a href=\"/opinion/344877/gayle-mcquoid-holley-individually-and-on-behalf-of-james-mcquoid-v-abe/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied sub nom.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span> (1978)--so that only those aliens who have received a letter from the Department of Justice stating that the INS does not contemplate enforcing his or her departure from the United States would be deemed to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law.  The district court rejected this argument on the ground that the plain meaning of p 3 precluded the Secretary's proposed reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also argued that the policy set forth in the decree--that aliens are to be considered permanently residing in the United States under color of law if they are here with the knowledge and permission of the INS and the INS does not contemplate enforcing their departure--had already been made clear in existing regulations.  The court rejected this argument, concluding that existing regulations and internal operating instructions suggested that the \"under color of law\" provision had a much narrower scope than that set forth in p 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court noted that the Secretary had advised the court that it was her position that the language of p 3 might cover some categories of aliens who did not qualify under the statute as permanent residents under color of law.  The court stated that the Secretary should pursue this argument by moving for relief from the judgment, rather than by refusing to carry out its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary subsequently moved under Rule 60(b)(5) for relief from the decree on the theory that certain portions of it were ultra vires and that, therefore, it would be inequitable for those portions to have prospective application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary argued that the legislative history of Section (B)(ii) indicated that the only aliens Congress intended to make eligible for SSI pursuant to the \"color of law\" language were political refugees and aliens who entered the country prior to July 1948.  The Secretary also contended that certain language in p 3 of the decree was confusing and inaccurate under current immigration law and procedure.  In a written opinion, the court rejected both of the Secretary's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court's ruling on the Rule 60(b) motion, the plaintiffs submitted a proposed final judgment.  The Secretary filed papers in opposition to this proposed modification, and--without relinquishing her right to challenge the substance of the court's construction of the decree--presented her own proposed amended final judgment.  In July 1984, the court signed an order which amended the decree largely, although by no means entirely, in accordance with the plaintiffs' proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Rule 59(e) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary then moved for a rehearing pursuant to Rule 59(e) on the grounds that (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the decree because the action was moot as to Berger and because the court could not grant relief to nonparties, and (2) the court lacked the power to order the Secretary to promulgate regulations and internal operating instructions.  The court rejected both of these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary then took this appeal from the district court's four orders, challenging the substance of the Amendment and its jurisdictional underpinnings.  We granted a stay of the district court's orders pending the outcome of the appeal.DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>I. The Court's Jurisdiction to Enforce the Decree</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's jurisdictional contentions are without merit.  First, she objects that the decree cannot be enforced because the action itself is moot;  second, she objects that the court's Amendment requires enforcement of the decree with respect to persons who are not parties to the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mootness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's first contention is that the action must be dismissed for mootness.  She argues that the action is moot because Berger--the only named beneficiary still alive<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>--is receiving the SSI benefits he sought in bringing the action.  She further argues that no one else is entitled to enforce the decree.  In the latter connection, she asserts that persons cannot intervene under Rule 71 to enforce the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Secretary's approach, the heart of the decree--p 3--would have been unenforceable at the moment it came into existence.  In other words, the Secretary would like to have it both ways:  she wants the litigation against her to be concluded based on her agreement--sanctioned by the court--to adopt a given interpretation of a statutory provision and yet, by providing those specifically named in the decree with benefits, she also wants to prevent the court from requiring her to implement this interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several reasons, we reject the Secretary's approach.  We find that the action was not moot as to Berger, and that the persons participating in the enforcement action were entitled to do so under Rule 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Secretary argues that since Berger is being provided SSI benefits under the decree, he is already receiving all the relief he sought in his action, and that the case is therefore moot as to him.  The Secretary, however, misstates the issue.  The consent decree entered in this action stipulated that Berger was eligible for SSI benefits, and that he would continue to receive benefits as long as his alienage status continued to make him eligible.  Berger asserted that the Secretary was not complying with the decree, and instituted contempt proceedings to enforce the decree.  The real question, therefore, is whether, in the face of the Secretary's alleged non-compliance, Berger was entitled to ensure, by means of proceedings to enforce the decree, that he continued to receive benefits, or whether he was precluded from so doing because he had not yet lost those benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   Thus, the issue is not--as the Secretary contends--whether the action is moot because Berger is currently receiving benefits.  Rather, the issue is the ripeness of his claim of noncompliance, i.e., whether the challenged conduct was sufficiently threatening to Berger to justify his invocation of the court's jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   This question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is axiomatic that the judicial power conferred by Art.

Petitioners argued that respondents had obtained complete relief under the consent judgment previously entered in the action, and that since the petitioners themselves had not been threatened with the type of transfer now challenged, they were without standing to object to those transfers.  The Court rejected petitioners' argument.  In determining that it had jurisdiction to hear respondents' claims, the Court reasoned that \"the nursing homes in which respondents reside remain free to determine ... that respondents' continued stay at current levels of care is not medically necessary.

This failure posed a threat to all those SSI recipients and applicants whose eligibility depended on the \"color of law\" provision.  A party's noncompliance with certain aspects of a decree is a powerful indication that the party may not feel bound to honor other aspects.   See Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1000-01, 102 S.Ct. at 2783-84 (citing O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 496, 94 S.Ct. at 676 (\"[P]ast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.\")).  In support of the motion for contempt, the court was presented with documents concerning various individuals who had been improperly denied benefits under the \"color of law\" provision.  The fact that Berger's benefits had not been terminated is of no moment;  under the circumstances, it was not necessary for Berger to wait for the axe to fall on him also before he brought suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree provides Berger with benefits only \"as long as his immigration status remains that of an alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law....\"  Under this language, his continued receipt of benefits remains dependent upon the Secretary's interpretation of the \"color of law\" provision, and, specifically, on her implementation of the interpretation set forth in p 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Her alleged noncompliance with p 3 was therefore a significant threat to Berger's interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   Thus, we agree with the district court that the Secretary's failure to properly educate agency staff regarding the eligibility standard under p 3 of the decree posed a threat to Berger that was sufficiently real and immediate to amount to an existing controversy entitling him to enforce the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Furthermore, under a second line of reasoning, we believe that basic contract principles supported Berger's right to move for enforcement of the decree.  The decree is a contract embodying promises made to Berger by the Secretary in exchange for the termination of his action.   See Dotson v.

Although no class was certified, the Secretary agreed in the decree (1) to provide benefits to the named beneficiaries, and (2) to adopt and apply the interpretation of the \"color of law\" provision set forth in p 3.  The promise incorporated in p 3 was made to Berger, as promisee.  Berger could therefore challenge noncompliance with p 3 and sue to enforce the promise it contained.  Moreover, to the extent that he was suing on behalf of third parties benefited by the decree, he was supported by state contract law, since in New York a promisee for the benefit of third parties may enforce the promise on behalf of the third parties.

Quinlan, supra, a case in which no class was certified, a contempt proceeding to enforce a consent decree providing for improvements in the county jail was instituted by the original plaintiffs who were no longer in custody in that jail.  The court found the action moot as to the original plaintiffs, and rejected the contention that Rule 71 provided a basis on which the original plaintiffs could enforce the decree.  The court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>It seems clear that Rule 71 was intended to assure that process be made available to enforce court orders in favor of and against persons who are properly affected by them, even if they are not parties to the action....  While Rule 71 may support a separate action by a present inmate to enforce the order obtained by the plaintiffs, it cannot be used by a party to enforce an order in an action in which he no longer has standing to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">558 F.2d at 1137.    Lasky effectively gave persons who were not original parties a green light to pursue enforcement of the consent decree at issue.   Cf. In re Spong, 661 F.2d at 10 (\"In a third party beneficiary contract, benefits flow to both the promisee and the third party, and either may sue to enforce the contract.\"    Id.

It is clear, however, that the Secretary misreads this language.  Of course, where, as here, plaintiff himself is able to pursue enforcement by means of a contempt proceeding, judicial economy virtually requires that appropriate persons be permitted to intervene under Rule 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Benefits to Nonparties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's second contention is that the court was without jurisdiction to enter the Amendment because it confers benefits on nonparties.  The Secretary points to the fact that no class was certified in this action, and argues that the power of the court does not extend to the granting of relief to any persons other than those named in the decree, since they were the only parties properly before the court.  Although the Secretary concedes that the original decree provided for relief to nonparties, she nevertheless asserts that this problem has only now become clear because \"the district court has ordered injunctive relief in favor of nonparties to effectuate its interpretation of the original consent judgment.\"    The Secretary's argument must be rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed a class complaint.  The consent decree was entered, however, prior to certification of a class, as the preamble to the decree specifically acknowledged.  When the Secretary raised the absence of class certification on her Rule 59(e) motion below, the plaintiffs made a motion for class certification.  The district court ruled that certification was unnecessary, and the motion, untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of class certification is not problematic in this case, and does not affect the enforceability of the Amendment or of the decree itself.  We agree with the court below that certification of a class was not necessary here since the decree's prospective \"relief will benefit all members of a proposed class to such an extent that the certification of a class would not further the implementation of the judgment.\"   Davis v.

The court reasoned,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>The defendants are public officials charged with compliance with and enforcement of federal as well as state laws.

Similarly, in Galvan v.

It is clear to this court that, in so doing, she also agreed to the enforcement of the decree in favor of nonparties.  Therefore, as in the above-cited cases, certification of a class was unnecessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Secretary had objections to the interpretation as set forth in the consent decree, she could have refused to sign the decree in 1978, or challenged the decree on direct appeal.  The judgment contained a stipulated interpretation of a statutory provision.  It is simply untenable for her to contend at this juncture that because she disagrees with the interpretation in the decree she will not be bound by it except as it affects persons within the Eastern District of New York.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary cites cases to the effect that injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.   See Califano v. Yamasaki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110116\"><a href=\"/opinion/110116/califano-v-yamasaki/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span>, 702, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110116\"><a href=\"/opinion/110116/califano-v-yamasaki/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1979).  Such cases are not, however, governing where, as here, the defendant consented to the relief provided.  Furthermore, the Secretary's position is in direct conflict with her own regulations which provide for nationwide uniformity in eligibility standards for the SSI program.  20 C.F.R.

Since there has been a final judgment disposing of this action on the consent of the parties, the constraints applicable upon the granting of preliminary extraordinary relief have no relevance here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Consent Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously discussed, the consent decree was amended by the district court after it had ruled, on a contempt motion, that the Secretary had failed to comply with certain of its central terms.  The procedural and substantive history of this case is a complex illustration of the dynamic interaction between the courts and litigants pursuant to the entry of a consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent decrees are a hybrid in the sense that they are at once both contracts and orders, see United States v.

It is recognized that a consent decree represents a compromise between parties who have waived their right to litigation and, in the interest of avoiding the risk and expense of suit, have \"give[n] up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation....

The district court found, pursuant to proceedings on plaintiffs' motion for contempt, that the Secretary was not in compliance with the consent decree.  Specifically, the court made the determination--here unchallenged--that the Secretary had not properly publicized the interpretation of the \"color of law\" language contained in p 3 of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the Secretary's argument that the existing agency regulations fully effectuated the terms of the decree, the court examined both the pertinent regulations--20 C.F.R. Secs. 416.1600(c), 416.1618<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>--and the agency's internal operating instructions.  The court found thatNeither of [the C.F.R.] provisions reflect ... the position of the Secretary as stated in [p] 3 of the final judgment ... that aliens residing in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS and whose departure from the United States the INS does not contemplate enforcing are permanently residing in the United States and may be eligible for SSI benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the agency's internal operating instructions, the court concluded,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are there any provisions in the [operations] manual broadly stating the Secretary's position.  Those provisions to which plaintiffs have referred ... limit the categories of aliens who may be eligible for SSI benefits as permanently residing in the United States under color of law to aliens admitted as refugees, aliens paroled indefinitely, aliens granted indefinite stays of deportation or voluntary departure for an indefinite period by the INS or the courts, and aliens granted asylum by the Attorney General.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court directed the Secretary to take steps to effectuate the terms of the final judgment by promulgating amendments to the agency's regulations, operations manuals and guidelines to reflect the Secretary's position as stated in p 3 of the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   In addition, the court ordered the parties to settle an amended final judgment clarifying p 3 of the original decree by setting forth some of the categories of aliens which were within the ambit of the standard set forth therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amendment ultimately entered by the court did not meet with the approval of the Secretary.  She now challenges the Amendment principally on the ground that it is ultra vires because it conflicts with Section (B)(ii).  She also argues that the Amendment is ultra vires because it goes beyond the scope of the original decree.  Finally, she argues that if the district court's broad reading of the original decree is proper, then the original decree is ultra vires because it conflicts with the underlying statute, and is therefore unenforceable as written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Instead, the phrase is designed to be adaptable and to be interpreted over time in accordance with experience, developments in the law, and the like.

It embraces not only situations within the body of the law, but also others enfolded by a colorable imitation.  \"Under color of law\" means that which an official does by virtue of power, as well as what he does by virtue of right.  The phrase encircles the law, its shadows, and its penumbra.  When an administrative agency or a legislative body uses the phrase \"under color of law\" it deliberately sanctions the inclusion of cases that are, in strict terms, outside the law but are near the border.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">553 F.2d at 849-50.  The Secretary's narrow interpretation of this language is thus clearly inconsistent with the expansive approach previously taken in this circuit--an approach we consider well-taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"permanently residing,\" which appears in Section (B)(ii), should also be read in accordance with our reasoning in Holley regarding that phrase.  There, the court stated that these words should be read in light of the INAct, which provides:  \"The term 'permanent' means a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the United States or of the individual, in accordance with law.\"    8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(31) (1982);  see Holley, 553 F.2d at 850-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the \"color of law\" language in the AFDC regulations discussed in Holley, the \"color of law\" language in Section (B)(ii) is modified by a parenthetical, and the effect of the parenthetical on the meaning of the phrase as a whole must be considered.  The phrase in the SSI statute reads as follows:  \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law (including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8).\"    As will be discussed below, section 1153(a)(7) provides for the conditional entry of certain aliens, and section 1182(d)(5) provides that the Attorney General may temporarily parole aliens into the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a common sense interpretation, the categories of aliens listed in the parenthetical are illustrative rather than definitive.  Although the parenthetical specifies two statutory provisions which entitle an alien to classification as a permanent resident under color of law, it does not thereby limit such classification to those who fall under those two provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This common sense interpretation has been codified.  Congress specifically provided, in the definitions applicable to the SSI statute, that the term \" 'including' when used in a definition ... shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\"    42 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(b) (1982);  see Holley, 533 F.2d at 851 (Section 1301(b) \"is a legislative caution to lean more on the 'ejusdem generis' than on the 'inclusio unius, exclusio alterius' cannon of construction.\").  Certainly, in light of this codification, the statutory provisions listed should be viewed as examples--members of a series whose scope is not delineated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot find any support in the language of Section (B)(ii) for the Secretary's limited interpretation of that provision.  She argues that Congress intended the \"color of law\" provision to confer eligibility on only two groups of aliens:  those who entered the country as refugees, and those who entered the country prior to June 30, 1948.  The language does not, however, say what the Secretary argues it means.    The language does not indicate that eligibility is limited to the two categories urged by the Secretary;  indeed, neither of these categories is referred to explicitly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the parenthetical appears on its face to undermine the Secretary's position.  The parenthetical lists two provisions, section 1153(a)(7) and section 1182(d)(5).  The first, section 1153(a)(7), provides for conditional entry, and addresses the entry of refugees in particular.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>   The second, section 1182(d)(5), is more general;  it permits the Attorney General to temporarily parole, for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest, any alien applying for admission to the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   Indeed, the Secretary, while explaining that the provision is used to allow entry to refugees, does not dispute that the provision is not limited to this purpose.  Nor does she contend that it is used solely for this purpose.  Thus, we find that the parenthetical weighs heavily against the Secretary's interpretation of Section (B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we find that the restrictive interpretation urged by the Secretary does not comport with the provision on its face, we are not adverse to examining the extrinsic materials presented by the Secretary in support of her position.  The intended scope of a statutory provision may be clarified by pertinent legislative history and administrative practice.  \"[W]here a word or phrase is reasonably capable of more than one meaning, we have repeatedly affirmed the wisdom of looking to the entire text of the statute and to its legislative history in order to ascertain, if possible, the intent of the drafters and true scope and meaning of the term.\"   Schwartz v.

Finance Report</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary first argues that the language in a Senate Finance Committee report shows that the language \"permanent resident under color of law\" was \"clearly intended to apply only to aliens who entered the United States before July, 1948.\"    She points to a discussion of a proposed change in the AFDC eligibility provisions.  The proposal was contained in H.R. 1, which also contained the SSI provisions, and evidently would have added the phrase \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" to the AFDC statute.  She cites the following language from the report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>Under the committee bill ..., States would be mandated in Federal law to require as a condition of eligibility for the AFDC welfare program ... that an individual be a resident of the United States and either a citizen or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or a person who is a permanent resident under color of law (that is, a person who entered the United States before July 1948 and who may be eligible for admission for permanent residence at the discretion of the Attorney General under section 1259 of title 8 of the United States Code).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep.

However, since this language was not enacted in the form discussed in the report, we are left entirely unpersuaded.  As previously indicated, the \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" language of Section (B)(ii) is modified by a parenthetical--\"(including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8)\".  This parenthetical not only patently broadens the meaning of the phrase beyond the interpretation contained in the Senate report, but also effectively contradicts the particular limitation the report advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Floor Amendment &amp; Sponsors' Remarks</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parenthetical grew out of two Senate floor amendments sponsored by Senators Chiles and Gurney of Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   The Secretary argues that the Chiles-Gurney amendments, which included \"color of law\" language, were \"intended simply to insure that Cuban refugees would be entitled to SSI,\" and that the \"color of law\" provision should be given an accordingly limited interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the amendments added the language \"or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" to the SSI eligibility provisions.  The other added a general definition of that language which was made expressly applicable throughout the various provisions of the Act amended by the bill.  This definition provided that \"the term 'alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law' shall include an alien refugee who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section [1153(a)(7) ] or section [1182(d)(5) ] of [Title 8].\"  The Senate approved the amendments by voice vote.  When H.R. 1 was reported out of the House Conference Committee, however, it contained the language of the parenthetical as ultimately enacted, rather than the Chiles-Gurney language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary cites the following remarks of Senator Chiles:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>[The amendments] simply make clear in the bill that it would not detract from the rights to benefits of Cuban refugees, of which 12,000 reside in Florida.  They are receiving benefits presently under the existing system [of state-administered federal categorical grants], but there has been some question as to whether, under this bill, they would be eligible.  These amendments would make it clear that they are eligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">118 Cong.Rec. 33959 (1972).  She also cites the following remarks of Senator Gurney:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>[T]hese amendments which we are introducing at this time are designed to prevent a great and unintended economic hardship being placed upon the people of Dade County, Fla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know that the Finance Committee and its distinguished chairman did not intend this result, however, the effect of the limiting language concerning aliens which appears ... on page 466 of the [Senate Finance C]ommittee report does just that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  It is the Secretary's argument that these remarks indicate that the amendments as proposed and the language as enacted were intended to restrict the meaning of the \"color of law\" language to cover only refugees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is--at most--a very slender reed on which to hang the Secretary's request that we find the Amendment at issue in conflict with the underlying statute.  Contemporaneous remarks of a sponsor of legislation are by no means controlling in the analysis of legislative history.   Weinberger v. Rossi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110687\"><a href=\"/opinion/110687/weinberger-v-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 35 n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110687\"><a href=\"/opinion/110687/weinberger-v-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span> (1982).  More to the point, such remarks are of little or no import where, as here, the legislature has subsequently included other language--albeit similar--in the law as enacted.  To permit clear statutory language to be materially altered by the remarks of the Senate sponsors before the bill achieved final form \"would open the door to the inadvertent, or perhaps even planned, undermining of the language actually voted on by Congress and signed into law by the President.\"   Regan v. Wald, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111243\"><a href=\"/opinion/111243/regan-v-wald/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Their language provided that the phrase should be interpreted to \"include an alien refugee [who is here pursuant to section 1153(a)(7) or section 1182(d)(5) of Title 8].\"  (Emphasis added).  As discussed supra, the word \"include\" is not restrictive;  it precedes an example of the members of a group.  The fact that the language of the amendment identified refugees as members of the group of aliens permanently residing in the United States \"under color of law\" does not indicate that aliens who are not refugees are necessarily excluded from that group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore find that the Secretary's arguments regarding the legislative history of Section (B)(ii) are without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>   Based on our examination of the language of the provision and our review of its legislative history, we find that the phrase, \"under color of law,\" is designed to be an open vessel--to be given substance by experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>   We agree with the district court's conclusion that the \"color of law\" provision is inherently elastic, and we reject the Secretary's restrictive interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Paragraph 3 of the Consent Decree</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also argues that the Amendment goes beyond the scope of the original decree by conferring SSI eligibility on aliens who were not eligible under the original p 3 as correctly construed.  She contends that terms agreed to in the original decree do not support the extension of benefits to the class covered by the Amendment.  As discussed below, we find that this argument is based on an incorrectly narrow interpretation of the decree which must be rejected.  The Secretary also argues that if the consent decree is not accorded the narrow interpretation she urges, then the decree itself is ultra vires because it exceeds the scope of the statute.  We reject this argument as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 3 of the original decree lists several categories of aliens who will be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color of law, and provides that any other alien residing in the United States \"with the knowledge and permission\" of the INS, whose departure the INS \"does not contemplate enforcing,\" is also permanently residing in the United States under color of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary maintains that this language is properly interpreted to cover only those aliens as to whom there has been an official determination or authorization, embodied in a letter, that the alien is legitimately present in the country for an indefinite period of time.  Although she concedes that the \"knowledge and permission\" language of the paragraph \"permit[s] a much broader reading,\" she argues that \"the government never contemplated such a ... reading.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary bases her argument in part on the well-established principle that a consent decree may be interpreted in light of \"the circumstances surrounding the ... order.\"   United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935.  She asserts that in this instance the decree originated out of, and should therefore be limited to, the facts presented by Berger and Mena, the two beneficiaries named in the decree.  This argument has no merit whatsoever.  Paragraph 3 is so written as to make untenable any limitation of its scope to the particular facts presented by the parties named in the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also relies on the maxim that a decree must be interpreted in light of the \"technical meaning words used may have had to the parties.\"    Id.  She contends that \"[t]he limited holding of Holley ... is obviously the 'technical meaning' \" of the words used in the consent decree here, and that under Holley the broad language of p 3 should be given the limitation she proposes, that is, that an official letter be a prerequisite to SSI eligibility under the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Holley, decided during the year before the consent decree was entered, the court determined that where an applicant for AFDC benefits is an alien parent who has official assurance that she will not be deported at least until her children are no longer dependent upon her, the parent is \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law\" and is thus eligible for AFDC under the governing regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   The court indicated that it considered plaintiff to be a member of a \"minuscule sub-class of aliens who, although unlawfully residing in the United States, are each individually covered by a letter ... stating that the [INS] 'does not contemplate enforcing ... [the alien's] departure from the United States at this time.' \"   Holley, 553 F.2d at 849.  Far more significant for the purposes of our analysis here, however, is the fact that the court found it appropriate to give an expansive interpretation to the phrase \"under color of law,\" and to adopt an interpretation of the phrase \"permanently residing\" in which the conception of \"permanent\" more closely resembled \"lasting\" or \"enduring,\" than \"forever.\"    We therefore find that, on balance, the decision in Holley cuts against the Secretary's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, although Holley involved an alien who had received a letter stating that no action to deport her was contemplated, we find no indication in the language of the decree before us that the receipt of such a letter is a prerequisite to \"color of law\" status.  While p 3 echoes the language of the letter in Holley--that is, the phrase, \"does not contemplate enforcing, etc.\"--the glaring absence of any mention in the decree that a letter to this effect would be required is fatal to the Secretary's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government's contemporaneous interpretation of Holley lends support to an expansive view of the consent decree, rather than a restrictive one.  The petition for certiorari in Holley--which was denied just four months before the decree was filed--was opposed by the United States, as amicus on behalf of respondent Holley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>   In its amicus brief, the government argued that the phrase \"residing under color of law\" includes those aliens whose residence in the United States is \"continued by virtue of official permission or acquiescence.\"    (Emphasis added).  The government also observed that the INAct provisions listed in the parenthetical--8 U.S.C. Secs. 1153(a)(7) and Sec. 1182(d)(5)--were merely \"illustrative examples,\" and further stated that they \"obviously forbid any narrow reading\" of the word \"permanently.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, viewed in the context in which it was drawn up, see ITT Continental Baking, 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935;  United States v. Bechtel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390280\"><a href=\"/opinion/390280/united-states-v-bechtel-corporation-bechtel-incorporated-bechtel-power/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 665 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span> (1981), the consent decree appears to have been entered into by the parties with the expectation that the language of p 3 would be construed expansively, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary must be rejected.  We agree with the district court that \"the plain meaning of [p ] 3 ... clearly goes beyond [her] limited interpretation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>   Furthermore, based on our analysis of the legislative history of Section (B)(ii), supra, we find no reason to believe that such an expansive reading of p 3 brings the decree into conflict with the underlying statute.  We therefore reject the Secretary's argument to that effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Paragraph 3 under the Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having rejected the Secretary's arguments under the statute and the original decree, we turn briefly to the challenged Amendment to confirm that it comports with our conclusions regarding the underlying statute.  We are satisfied that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Amendment provides, in pertinent part, that p 3 of the consent judgment filed on June 13, 1978, is modified to include the language set out in the margin (\"amended p 3\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>   Amended p 3 essentially reiterates the language of the original p 3, and then sets out a non-exclusive list of eleven categories of aliens falling within the \"color of law\" provision.  Finally, it states the circumstances under which an alien will be considered \"as one whose departure the INS does not contemplate enforcing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the Secretary's specific challenges to the Amendment on the grounds set out in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and note that we find the Amendment otherwise in conformity with both the letter and the spirit of the underlying statute and the original decree.  In particular, the concept of permanence incorporated in Section (B)(ii) is in no way slighted in the decree or the Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>   Rather, both the decree and the Amendment reinforce the \"permanently residing\" language of the statutory provision.  Both are, of course, to be read in light of the approach to permanence taken in Holley.    There, the court gave great weight to the INAct's definition of permanence, and observed that the INAct provisions in the parenthetical in Section (B)(ii) are \"instances where the alien is permitted to stay in the United States not necessarily forever, but only so long as he is in a particular condition.\"    553 F.2d at 851.  The provisions of the Amendment are written so that they may be executed in accordance with the same standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Requiring the Issuance of Regulations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also contends that the district court lacked the power to order her to promulgate regulations implementing the provisions of p 3 as amended.  We find that the court acted within its authority in so doing.  We believe, however, that the court overstepped its authority when it required that certain language be contained in the regulations.  We therefore affirm the district court's action with the proviso that the order must be modified to exclude the requirement, set out in p 4, that specified language appear in the regulations issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary asserts, citing 42 U.S.C. Secs. 405(a), 1383(d)(1) (1982), that \"[p]rescription of final regulations ... usurps the Secretary's statutory grant of authority to promulgate regulations,\" see also 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1302 (1982), and that requiring their promulgation is therefore not a remedy the court has the power to provide.  Plaintiffs assert that, pursuant to a finding of noncompliance by the Secretary, the court was empowered to direct her to promulgate regulations in accordance with the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before us is whether the Secretary may continue to operate under regulations which do not comport with a judgment of the court entered upon consent of the parties.  In reaching our conclusion that the district court's directive to promulgate regulations was proper under the circumstances, we are particularly persuaded by three considerations:  (1) the Secretary had already promulgated regulations regarding SSI eligibility prior to the court's order;  (2) the district court had found that the Secretary was not in compliance with the original decree;  and (3) the Secretary had given her consent to the terms of the original decree.  We address these factors below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Secretary has already chosen to promulgate regulations on the very issue of SSI eligibility which is before us.  See supra note 20.  Further, she has revised these regulations since the entry of the consent decree.  Indeed, the fact that the regulations promulgated subsequent to the decree did not comport with the decree indicates that the court was, in effect, forced to order that further regulations be promulgated to ensure compliance with the terms of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the balance between the powers of the court and the powers of the executive is not at issue here.  This is not an occasion in which the Secretary had chosen to refrain from taking any action.   See Heckler v. Chaney, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Paragraph 5 of the decree is reasonably interpreted to require the promulgation of appropriate regulations.  When the court found that the Secretary had failed to otherwise effectuate the eligibility standard incorporated in p 3, the court was authorized to require her to issue regulations to effectuate that standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under its power to take reasonable steps to enforce its orders, see, e.g., Class v.

Further, the plaintiffs who had bargained for the terms of the decree, and agreed to cease litigating on the basis of the decree were entitled to have the decree enforced as written.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ordering the promulgation of regulations, the district court asked no more than that the Secretary \"meet its responsibilities by adopting a fair ... rule within a reasonable period of time.\"   British Airways Bd. v.

The court observed at the outset that the issue of \"infringement of agency discretion [which] ... normally arises in the context of a judicial order disposing of a case on its merits ... is framed somewhat differently here because the Decree was entered with [the agency's ] consent.\"    Id.

Because the consent decree in Gorsuch was largely the work of the agency and the other parties to the litigation rather than the work of the district court, the appellate court concluded that \"the requirements imposed by the Decree do not represent judicial intrusion into the Agency's affairs to the same extent they would if the Decree were 'a creature of judicial cloth.' \"    Id.

Berger did not enter this country as a refugee and did not arrive prior to July 1948.  Thus, Berger's eligibility for SSI would be in jeopardy if the court were persuaded by the Secretary's argument that SSI eligibility pursuant to the \"color of law\" provision is limited to refugees and persons who entered the United States prior to July 1948</p>\n        <p>The Secretary's observation--in a footnote unrelated to her mootness claim--that Berger's particular circumstances gave him \"the effective equivalent of refugee status,\" and her representation that she does not intend to terminate Berger's benefits do not eliminate the threat posed to Berger by the Secretary's failure to comply with the decree.  She has presented him with no affidavit setting forth these assurances.  In any event, he would remain dependent upon her compliance for continued receipt of benefits, and she might at any time resolve that he does not meet the \"color of law\" standard.   Cf.

See Rodriguez v. Swank, 496 F.2d at 1111-13.  Although we might, under that approach, treat the district court's Amendment in this case as an exercise of the court's power to hold a party in contempt, we rest our analysis instead on the district court's even more basic authority to compel compliance with its orders</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Section 416.1600 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>In this subpart, we tell you what kinds of evidence show that you are a resident of the United States (see Sec. 416.1603) and--</p>\n        <p>(a) A citizen or a national of the United States (see Sec. 416.1610);</p>\n        <p>(b) An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States (see Sec. 416.1615);  or</p>\n        <p>(c) An alien permanently residing in the United States under color of law (see Sec. 416.1618).</p>\n        <p>Section 416.1618, to which the reader is referred by section 416.1600(c), is entitled \"How to prove you are permanently residing in the United States under color of law.\"    It lists certain forms and documents that will be accepted as proof that the alien satisfies section 416.1600(c).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The Secretary was also directed to comply with that portion of the consent decree which required her to provide notification regarding the p 3 standard to persons who had been denied benefits on the basis of their alienage status, and to inform them of their right to contest their denial of benefits</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> We do not reach this issue here since we find, upon examination of the statute in question and the arguments put forward, that the Amendment is in no way inconsistent with the underlying statutory provision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The AFDC regulations in issue, then contained at 45 C.F.R.

She agrees to the following three categories:  those who were admitted as refugees, those who have been residents since before July 1948, and those granted political asylum.  These groups are listed as categories (e), (i) and (d) in amended p 3</p>\n        <p>Of the eight other categories listed, four appear to be challenged on the ground that they do not comport with the \"permanently residing\" requirement of Section (B)(ii), since they would, inter alia, confer SSI eligibility on mere applicants for various types of relief or review.  See (a), (b), (c), (j).  This argument is not persuasive since the categories are, in all four instances, limited to those aliens \"whose departure the INS does not contemplate enforcing.\"    The latter qualification satisfactorily reflects and enforces the \"permanently residing\" requirement of the statute.  Of course, any applicants otherwise falling within the categories listed would also have to meet this qualification.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary challenges three other categories on the ground that, although they were covered by the original decree, \"the legislative history of the SSI statute indicates that [some or all of the aliens in these categories] are not entitled to SSI.\"    See (g), (h), (k).  Since we have already rejected the Secretary's arguments based on legislative history, we need not concern outselves further with these challenges.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary's final challenge is based on her assertion that the immigration status listed in (f) \"has little if any meaning\" under current usage, and that it is virtually never given for indefinite periods of time.  Like the district court, we see no reason to eliminate this category based on such an analysis.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary's remaining argument, regarding the disjunctive \"or\" in the final paragraph, is without merit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn35\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35_ref\">35</a>\n        <p> It should also be noted that the Secretary, in conjunction with Congress, has established a thirty-day residency requirement for SSI recipients.  See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1382c(a)(1)(B) (1982);  20 C.F.R. Secs. 416.1600, 416.1605 (1984)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 4 of the Amendment reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Within 90 days of the entry of this amendment to the consent judgment, the defendant Secretary shall promulgate sections of the [operations m]anual that fully implement the provisions and contain the language of amended [p ] 3 above.

Here, neither the Commissioner, nor the tax court addressed the issue of whether the notice of deficiency was issued in a timely fashion.  Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the tax court to consider, in the first instance, whether the Commissioner issued the notice of deficiency for tax year 1982 within the prescribed statutory period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>B.

This contention lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bybees had the burden of presenting evidence proving the Commissioner's assessment incorrect and proving that they were entitled to claim the expense deductions.   Smith v. Commissioner, 800 F.2d 930, 933 (9th Cir.1986).  We review the tax court's determination that the Bybees failed to meet their burden for clear error.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") a taxpayer may deduct \"ordinary and necessary expenses ... incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\"  26 U.S.C. Sec. 162(a).  \"An expense is generally not deductible under section 162 unless the taxpayer is engaged in an ongoing business at the time the expense is incurred.\"   Kantor v. Commissioner, 998 F.2d 1514, 1518 (9th Cir.1993).  Consequently, \"a nascent business may not deduct its 'start-up' or 'pre-operational' expenses under section 162 and must instead capitalize them.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Bybees' tax returns for tax years 1982 and 1983 described Gary Bybee's main business activity as \"land developer\" and the product as a \"toxic waste storage site.\"   The return listed $29,314 and $34,669 respectively, in expenses yet reported no gross receipts or sales and claimed no cost of goods sold.  The Bybees' tax return for 1984 identified Gary Bybee's main business activity as \"research and consulting\" and the product as \"security.  The return showed $166.67 in gross receipts and sought a deduction for $33,065.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Gary Bybee testified that the purpose of his business was to find ways to prevent low-level nuclear and toxic waste from entering the food and water chain.  He was forced, however, to abandon his efforts because of illness and financial difficulties.  During the tax years at issue, Bybee failed to make any income from his activities, complete an actual product, enter into any contracts, or obtain permits for the construction of a waste disposal site.  He also testified that he knew that it would take years for his efforts and research to come to fruition.  Although Bybee testified that he had worked with a team of professionals, including several nuclear scientists, he refused to identify any members of this team, and admitted that the only persons he ever actually hired were his three sons.  Thus, his deductions for \"legal-professional services\" and \"travel and entertainment\" represented his sons' \"legal-work\" on his behalf.  This work included research at the universities they attended and obtaining and reading periodicals.  Bybee stated that rather than paying his sons a salary, he covered their school and living expenses.  Accordingly, at least some of the claimed office expenses consisted of the rent paid on his son's college apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court found that Bybee failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish that he was engaged in an ongoing trade or business.  Thus, the court found that Bybee's investigation of business possibilities, prospects, and potential customers did not constitute carrying on a trade or business as defined under section 162.  We agree.   See Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bybee's alleged business expenses also were not deductible pursuant to section 174 of the Code.  Section 174(a)(1) permits a taxpayer to deduct \"research or experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business.\"  26 U.S.C. Sec. 174(a)(1);   Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.  For section 174 to apply, however, \"the taxpayer must demonstrate a 'realistic prospect' of subsequently entering its own business in connection with the fruits of the research, assuming that the research is successful.\"   Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.  Thus, the taxpayer must manifest \"both the objective intent to enter such a business and the capability of doing so.\"   Id.  Here, the Bybees failed to present any evidence demonstrating that they had the financial or organizational capability to establish a waste disposal business.  Accordingly, because there was no \"realistic prospect\" of the Bybees entering a waste disposal business as a result of their research efforts, they were not entitled to claim the deductions pursuant to section 174(a)(1).  Given these circumstances, the tax court did not clearly err by sustaining the Commissioner's deficiency determination for tax years 1982 through 1984.   See Smith, 800 F.2d at 933.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Additions to Tax</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bybees contend that the tax court erred by upholding the IRS's assessments of additions to tax for negligence under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6653(a) and for substantial understatement of income tax under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661.  This court reviews the tax court's decision upholding these additions to tax for clear error.   Norgaard v. Commissioner, 939 F.2d 874, 877 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negligence under section 6653(a) is defined as \"the lack of due care or the failure to do what a reasonable and prudent person would do under similar circumstances.\"   Allen v. Commissioner, 925 F.2d 348, 353 (9th Cir.1991).  Section 6653(a)(1) imposes a five percent addition to tax against a taxpayer when any part of an underpayment is due to negligence.  Id.  Prior to 1988, section 6653(a)(1) also imposed a penalty of fifty percent of the interest due on the underpayment.  Id.  Because the IRS's assessment of a section 6653(a) addition to tax is presumed correct, the Bybees had the burden of proving that the underpayment was not the result of negligence.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Bybees testified that they relied on the IRS publication \"Tax Guide for Small Businesses\" to claim their deductions.  As the tax court noted, however, this publication explicitly states that start-up costs such as travel expenses and research expenditures are not deductible but rather need to be capitalized.  The tax court also correctly noted that many of the Bybees' alleged business expenses appeared to be personal in nature, and that the Bybees had failed to seek outside advice on the tax implications of their business activities.  Given these circumstances, the tax court did not clearly err by imposing the negligence penalty.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Substantial Understatement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the Bybees filed the returns at issue, section 6661 provided for an addition to tax equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to a substantial understatement.  See former 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  An understatement was substantial if it exceeded the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000.  See id. Sec. 6661(b)(1)(A).  Where a taxpayer had \"reasonable cause\" or substantial authority to support the understatement and acted in good faith, the IRS had discretion to waive the penalty.  See id. Sec. 6661(c);   Norgaard, 939 F.2d at 880.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IRS determined that the Bybees were liable under section 6661 for a substantial understatement of tax for tax years 1982 through 1984.  Because the Bybees understated their tax by more than ten percent for these tax years, the amounts assessed were correct.  See former 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661(b)(1)(A).

See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") a taxpayer may deduct \"ordinary and necessary expenses ... incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\"  26 U.S.C. Sec. 162(a).  \"An expense is generally not deductible under section 162 unless the taxpayer is engaged in an ongoing business at the time the expense is incurred.\"   Kantor v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611598\"><a href=\"/opinion/611598/sharon-d-kantor-robert-e-kantor-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1514</span></a></span>, 1518 (9th Cir.1993).  Consequently, \"a nascent business may not deduct its 'start-up' or 'pre-operational' expenses under section 162 and must instead capitalize them.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Bybees' tax returns for tax years 1982 and 1983 described Gary Bybee's main business activity as \"land developer\" and the product as a \"toxic waste storage site.\"   The return listed $29,314 and $34,669 respectively, in expenses yet reported no gross receipts or sales and claimed no cost of goods sold.  The Bybees' tax return for 1984 identified Gary Bybee's main business activity as \"research and consulting\" and the product as \"security.  The return showed $166.67 in gross receipts and sought a deduction for $33,065.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Gary Bybee testified that the purpose of his business was to find ways to prevent low-level nuclear and toxic waste from entering the food and water chain.  He was forced, however, to abandon his efforts because of illness and financial difficulties.  During the tax years at issue, Bybee failed to make any income from his activities, complete an actual product, enter into any contracts, or obtain permits for the construction of a waste disposal site.  He also testified that he knew that it would take years for his efforts and research to come to fruition.  Although Bybee testified that he had worked with a team of professionals, including several nuclear scientists, he refused to identify any members of this team, and admitted that the only persons he ever actually hired were his three sons.  Thus, his deductions for \"legal-professional services\" and \"travel and entertainment\" represented his sons' \"legal-work\" on his behalf.  This work included research at the universities they attended and obtaining and reading periodicals.  Bybee stated that rather than paying his sons a salary, he covered their school and living expenses.  Accordingly, at least some of the claimed office expenses consisted of the rent paid on his son's college apartments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax court found that Bybee failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish that he was engaged in an ongoing trade or business.  Thus, the court found that Bybee's investigation of business possibilities, prospects, and potential customers did not constitute carrying on a trade or business as defined under section 162.  We agree.   See Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bybee's alleged business expenses also were not deductible pursuant to section 174 of the Code.  Section 174(a)(1) permits a taxpayer to deduct \"research or experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business.\"  26 U.S.C. Sec. 174(a)(1);   Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.  For section 174 to apply, however, \"the taxpayer must demonstrate a 'realistic prospect' of subsequently entering its own business in connection with the fruits of the research, assuming that the research is successful.\"   Kantor, 998 F.2d at 1518.  Thus, the taxpayer must manifest \"both the objective intent to enter such a business and the capability of doing so.\"   Id.  Here, the Bybees failed to present any evidence demonstrating that they had the financial or organizational capability to establish a waste disposal business.  Accordingly, because there was no \"realistic prospect\" of the Bybees entering a waste disposal business as a result of their research efforts, they were not entitled to claim the deductions pursuant to section 174(a)(1).  Given these circumstances, the tax court did not clearly err by sustaining the Commissioner's deficiency determination for tax years 1982 through 1984.   See Smith, 800 F.2d at 933.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Additions to Tax</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bybees contend that the tax court erred by upholding the IRS's assessments of additions to tax for negligence under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6653(a) and for substantial understatement of income tax under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661.  This court reviews the tax court's decision upholding these additions to tax for clear error.   Norgaard v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565121\"><a href=\"/opinion/565121/preben-norgaard-sandra-c-norgaard-v-commissioner-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span>, 877 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negligence under section 6653(a) is defined as \"the lack of due care or the failure to do what a reasonable and prudent person would do under similar circumstances.\"   Allen v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555553\"><a href=\"/opinion/555553/kenneth-allen-barbara-allen-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 353 (9th Cir.1991).  Section 6653(a)(1) imposes a five percent addition to tax against a taxpayer when any part of an underpayment is due to negligence.  Id.  Prior to 1988, section 6653(a)(1) also imposed a penalty of fifty percent of the interest due on the underpayment.  Id.  Because the IRS's assessment of a section 6653(a) addition to tax is presumed correct, the Bybees had the burden of proving that the underpayment was not the result of negligence.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Bybees testified that they relied on the IRS publication \"Tax Guide for Small Businesses\" to claim their deductions.  As the tax court noted, however, this publication explicitly states that start-up costs such as travel expenses and research expenditures are not deductible but rather need to be capitalized.  The tax court also correctly noted that many of the Bybees' alleged business expenses appeared to be personal in nature, and that the Bybees had failed to seek outside advice on the tax implications of their business activities.  Given these circumstances, the tax court did not clearly err by imposing the negligence penalty.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Substantial Understatement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the Bybees filed the returns at issue, section 6661 provided for an addition to tax equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to a substantial understatement.  See former 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  An understatement was substantial if it exceeded the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000.  See id. Sec. 6661(b)(1)(A).  Where a taxpayer had \"reasonable cause\" or substantial authority to support the understatement and acted in good faith, the IRS had discretion to waive the penalty.  See id. Sec. 6661(c);   Norgaard, 939 F.2d at 880.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IRS determined that the Bybees were liable under section 6661 for a substantial understatement of tax for tax years 1982 through 1984.  Because the Bybees understated their tax by more than ten percent for these tax years, the amounts assessed were correct.  See former 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6661(b)(1)(A).  The Bybees presented no evidence showing they had reasonable cause for the understatement or substantial authority for their position.  See id. Sec. 6661(c);   Norgaard, 939 F.2d at 880.  Thus, the tax court did not err by upholding the IRS's addition to tax for substantial understatement.

In re Qi Ju Zheng, No. A076 684 568 (B.I.A.\n\nJune 27, 2008).     We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\n\nunderlying facts and procedural history of the case.\n\n    We review the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion, mindful that such motions are\n\n“‘disfavored.’”     See Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d\n\nCir. 2006) (quoting INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 322-23\n\n(1992)).   An alien who has been ordered removed may file one\n\nmotion to reopen within ninety days of the final\n\nadministrative order of removal.     8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7).\n\nThis deadline may be excused if the alien can establish\n\n\n                                2\n\f“changed country conditions arising in the country of\n\nnationality.”     8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).     Here, the BIA properly denied\n\nZheng’s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed\n\nmore than five years after his May 6, 2002 final order of\n\nremoval.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n    Relying on Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 109 (2d\n\nCir. 2006), Zheng maintains that he has adduced new evidence\n\nestablishing that he would be forcibly sterilized based on\n\nthe birth of his two United States-born children.     This\n\nargument is foreclosed by Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d\n\n138, 169, 172-73 (2d Cir. 2008), which explained that the\n\ndocuments adduced in Guo do not, by themselves, demonstrate\n\nan alien’s prima facie eligibility for relief.     Accordingly,\n\nthe BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng’s\n\nmotion to reopen.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii);\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).\n\n    With respect to Zheng’s derivative asylum claim, as the\n\ngovernment concedes, the BIA erroneously relied on Zheng’s\n\nage at the time his derivative asylum application was filed,\n\nrather than at the time his father’s asylum application was\n\n\n\n                                3\n\ffiled.    8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(B).   Remand, however, would be\n\nfutile because the BIA properly found that Zheng is now\n\nmarried and therefore does not qualify as a child eligible\n\nto derive asylum from his parent under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(3)(B).    See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice,\n\n471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that error does\n\nnot require remand if remand would be futile); see also\n\nAkhtar v. Gonzales, 406 F.3d 399, 407 (6th Cir. 2005)\n\n(holding that agency properly precluded petitioner, who\n\nturned twenty-one years old while his parent’s application\n\nwas pending, from applying for derivative asylum because he\n\nwas married).\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\nDENIED.    As we have completed our review, any stay of\n\nremoval that the Court previously granted in this petition\n\nis VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in\n\nthis petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for\n\noral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with\n\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second\n\nCircuit Local Rule 34.1(b).\n\n                              FOR THE COURT:\n                              Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                               4\n\f",

On February 15 Jones applied for bail, and on March 2 petitioner Jago filed a notice of appeal and moved for a stay of execution of the judgment.  The district court denied both the request for bail and the motion for a stay on March 7. Jago sought in this court a stay of the judgment, which was granted on April 19.  Upon a renewed application for bail, the district court on June 24, 1977 ordered Jones released pending the appeal on the condition that he post bail in the amount of $10,000, ten percent deposit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ordering Jones' release, District Judge Frank J. Battisti noted that the 90-day period for a new trial had long since expired and that the appellate process promised to last several more months.  He concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Under these circumstances, continued imprisonment of the petitioner by the state can no longer be justified.  The petitioner is possessed of a final judgment that his trial did not meet constitutional standards of fairness and is by now entitled to release on bail while the state pursues its appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state asserts that after he had originally denied bail and a notice of appeal had been filed, the district judge was without any power to act.  At first blush this position appears to have much merit, especially in the light of the express language of Rule 23(d), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>An initial order respecting the custody or enlargement of the prisoner and any recognizance or surety taken, shall govern review in the court of appeals and in the Supreme Court unless for special reasons shown to the court of appeals or to the Supreme Court, or to a judge or justice of either court, the order shall be modified, or an independent order respecting custody, enlargement or surety shall be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon a literal reading of the rule, the state argues that the district judge's \"initial\" order denied release and thus must govern Jones' custody during appeal unless changed by the court of appeals for \"special reasons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the state relies upon the general proposition that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction and transfers such jurisdiction to the court of appeals, citing the following Sixth Circuit cases: Oak Construction Co. v. Huron Cement Co., 475 F.2d 1220 (6th Cir. 1973); Hogg v. United States, 411 F.2d 578 (6th Cir. 1969); Keohane v. Swarco, Inc., 320 F.2d 429 (6th Cir. 1963); United States v. Frank B. Killian Co., 269 F.2d 491 (6th Cir. 1959); Walker v. Felmont Oil Corp., 262 F.2d 163 (6th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 840, 80 S.Ct. 61, 4 L.Ed.2d 78 (1959).  The order granting bail was entered after the notice of appeal had been filed and the case docketed in this court.  Thus the state contends that the district court acted without jurisdiction.  The earlier order denying bail, while also entered after the appeal was noted, is not subject to this defect, it urges, because an application had been made prior to the filing of the notice.  The state also correctly points out that habeas corpus petitioners are not subject to the provisions of Rule 9, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, pertaining to admission to bail of defendants in direct criminal appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering similar arguments in the district court, Judge Battisti concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The respondent interprets this rule (23(d)) to mean that modification of an initial order respecting custody is limited to the appellate courts.  But, clearly, this is a misreading of the provision.  Though the rule indicates the truism that on review in the court of appeals or the Supreme Court an order can only be modified by a judge or justice of that court, it neither states nor implies that the district court is divested of jurisdiction to modify or reconsider its orders concerning custody.  In fact this rule states a limitation on the discretion of appellate courts to modify initial orders and, thereby, reemphasizes the responsibility of the district court to determine the propriety of release pending appeal.  According to this rule, absent \"special reasons,\" the appellate courts are, in fact, to be governed by the rulings made by the lower courts regarding custody.  Hence, this court not only has jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's motion by virtue of Rule 23(c), but also has a special obligation to modify, if the circumstances require, an order which the court of appeals might otherwise consider binding by virtue of Rule 23(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Rule 23(c) states that a successful petitioner for habeas corpus \"shall be enlarged\" pending appeal, unless the court otherwise orders.  After thorough review of the historical precedents to Rule 23(c), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in United States ex rel. Thomas v. New Jersey, 472 F.2d 735 (1973) that under Rule 23(c) there is \"a very strong presumption that a petitioner holding a final judgment that his detention is unlawful should not be left in state custody\" and, further, that the court should exercise its discretion to allow the state to retain custody only in \"limited situations,\" supra at 743.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues raised by the superintendent's petition are ones of first impression in this circuit and have considerable practical importance in the administration of the law of habeas corpus in the federal courts.  A consideration of the historical role of habeas corpus generally and of Rule 23 in particular persuades us that Judge Battisti retained the power to release Jones under the circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any consideration of the meaning of Rule 23 and of the retained authority of the district judge to enter orders affecting custody after filing of the notice of appeal must begin with the recognition that \"(e)ssentially, the proceeding is unique.  Habeas corpus practice in the federal courts has conformed with civil practice only in a general sense.\"  Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 294, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 1087, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969); accord, Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 490 n. 4, 91 S.Ct. 995, 28 L.Ed.2d 251 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there may be a justifiable inclination to consider contemporary habeas corpus proceedings in federal court primarily as vehicles for the resolution of knotty constitutional issues, the writ is essentially a very physical one.  This is its fundamental nature even today.  Above all it deals with the issue of personal freedom from imposed restraints.  In its most literal terms, a writ commands a custodian to bring the aggrieved party into the presence of the judge issuing the writ and at that time to justify the detention.  Historically the judge then inquired into the custodian's reasons, and if he found them unlawful or inadequate, he ordered the immediate release of the person so held and the matter was closed.  Immediacy was and is its essence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>This is a high prerogative writ, and therefore by the common law issuing out of the court of the king's bench not only in term-time, but also during the vacation, by a fiat from the chief justice or any other of the judges, and running into all parts of the king's dominions: for the king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 W.

It is important to remember, however, that the prisoners in state correctional institutions are not the only potential beneficiaries of the writ or of the laws authorizing federal judges to issue it.  The Supreme Court has commented, \"It is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.\"  Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 243, 83 S.Ct. 373, 377, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying physical nature of habeas corpus proceedings has been well stated by Judge Hastie, concurring in Johnston v. Marsh, 227 F.2d 528, 532 (3rd Cir. 1955):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Unique procedure characterizes the administration of the remedy of habeas corpus.  When a court with jurisdiction of the subject matter receives a petition for habeas corpus which is not inadequate on its face, normal procedure is to issue a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the person who is detaining the petitioner to bring him before the court for hearing and decision whether he is unlawfully deprived of his liberty.  The district court issued such an order here and in obedience thereto the state warden produced his prisoner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>At that juncture the body of the petitioner came under the lawful control of the district court.  In legal contemplation that control continues pending decision whether to free the petitioner or to return him to state custody.  During that period detention is by force of the writ of habeas corpus, and the antecedent detaining authority is superseded for the time being.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Normally, where the petitioner is a prisoner serving a sentence upon conviction of crime, the court before which he is brought by writ of habeas corpus directs the warden to hold him until the court can decide the case.  But this procedure is not in derogation of the controlling concept that the body is being held pendente lite under authority and subject to order of the court which has issued the writ.  Once this concept is recognized, it becomes clear that the particular interim disposition which the court makes of the body is a judicial function of that court to be discharged, absent any controlling statute, in the exercise of judicial discretion, all relevant circumstances considered.  The court is under no ministerial duty to direct or permit the person who produces the petitioner to continue to hold him during this period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnston v. Marsh typifies the problems concerning physical custody which must necessarily be faced in a very practical way by the habeas corpus judge where there is delay in reaching a disposition of the petitioner's case.  In Johnston the petitioner was admitted to bail pending disposition on the merits by the district court, where it was shown that he was an advanced diabetic and was, under the conditions of confinement, rapidly progressing toward total blindness.  The state prisoner thus required hospitalization, and the court conditioned the admission to bail upon his going to and remaining in a private hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Goodrich's opinion in Johnston traced to some extent the exercise of the authority to admit to bail in habeas corpus cases, pending decision on the merits, as recognized in England and in the United States:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>One of the inherent powers of the judiciary with regard to proceedings before it has been the admission of a prisoner to bail where, in the exercise of his discretion, the judge deems it advisable.  It is clear that at common law courts had the inherent power to grant bail.  See, e. g., Queen v. Spilsbury, (1898) 2 Q.B. 615, 620.  This authority was exercised in habeas corpus cases pending decision on the merits.  In re Kaine, 1852, 14 How. 103, 133, 55 U.S. 103, 133, 14 L.Ed. 345 (dissent); Barth v. Clise, 1870, 12 Wall. 400, 402, 79 U.S. 400, 402, 20 L.Ed. 393; 16 English &amp; Empire Digest 268 (1923).  Our Federal judiciary has consistently recognized that at common law this inherent power existed.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Carapa v. Curran, 2 Cir., 1924, 297 F. 946, 954, 36 A.L.R. 877; United States v. Evans, C.C., 1880, 2 F. 147, 152; Ewing v. United States, 6 Cir., 1917, 240 F. 241, 248.  Yet whether Federal courts have this authority has been the subject of considerable controversy.  The principal cases are compiled in Principe v. Ault, D.C.N.D.Ohio 1945, 62 F.Supp. 279, 281.  On apparently the only occasion at which this question has been presented to it, the Supreme Court, in dicta, said that it was unwilling to hold that circuit courts do not have this inherent power.  Wright v. Henkel, 1903, 190 U.S. 40, 63, 23 S.Ct. 781, 47 L.Ed. 948.  We believe that the basic misconception in those decisions denying this authority lies in their view that since Federal courts have limited, statutory jurisdiction, their powers in proceedings involving this jurisdiction are necessarily limited and must be statutory.  See Principe v. Ault, D.C.N.D.Ohio 1945, 62 F.Supp. 279, 282.  This, as already indicated, is not our view of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">227 F.2d at 531 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule that an appeal to the circuit court deprives the district court of jurisdiction as to any matters involved in the appeal is neither \"a creature of statute\" nor \"absolute in character.\"  Hoffman v. Beer Drivers &amp; Salesmen's Local Union 888, 536 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1976).  Contrary to the contention of the state, the question concerning physical custody of the defendant pending review does not affect the matters involved in the appeal itself.  The habeas petitioner is not physically transferred to the appellate court, though the issues concerning his petition are presented there.  The order from which the appeal is taken provided that because of a constitutional violation in his state court trial, the petitioner should be granted the writ unless the state retried him in ninety days.  This decision did not in any way relate to or concern the matter of his custody pending the appeal, although his personal freedom was at issue in each instance.  In this respect, the case is not unlike many others in which the district court has of necessity a retained power to act even though a judgment in the case may be the subject of a pending appeal.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 203.11 at 734-35 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hogg v. United States, supra, we recognized that a district court continues to have jurisdiction to act in aid of the appeal as authorized under the federal rules. 411 F.2d at 580.  Certainly if the physical welfare of the petitioner is the responsibility of the district court during the appeal and if the question of his custody does not affect the merits of the appeal itself, it is not unreasonable to believe that there is a retained power in the district court to aid the appeal by undertaking that responsibility, at least in the absence of its exercise by an appellate court.  In Hoffman v. Beer Drivers, supra, the Ninth Circuit went so far as to permit the district court's alteration of a preliminary injunction in a labor dispute even though that very injunction was then pending in the court of appeals.  The court reasoned that because there was a continuing necessity to maintain a status quo in light of new facts which developed after the entry of the original order, the district court ought to be allowed to retain supervisory control as the circumstances dictated. 536 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar responsibility for custody decisions is reserved in the district court for direct criminal appeals by the express provisions of Rule 9(b), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Release pending an appeal must be first sought in the district court even after an appeal has been noted from the judgment of conviction.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 209.01(2) at 1504, P 209.06 at 1512 (2d ed. 1975).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We believe that a proper understanding of the history of Rule 23 supports a conclusion that it, also, preserves in the district judge authority to issue one or more orders regarding the custody or enlargement of a prisoner pending the review of the decision in the habeas corpus action.  The district court does not lose his jurisdiction when an appeal is noted from the decision.  However, on motion by a party, the court of appeals or a single judge of the court may modify any such order, or make an independent custody order, but only where \"special reasons\" are found to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good summary of the history of Rule 23, particularly subdivision (c) which is applicable in this case, is found in United States ex rel. Thomas v. New Jersey, 472 F.2d 735 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S.Ct. 121, 38 L.Ed.2d 123 (1973).  There the district court had granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner and ordered that if no appeal was taken by the state and no retrial was begun within 60 days, the petitioner was to be released.  The order also stated that during the pending appeal the state county court was to entertain an application for bail by the petitioner, which was to be fixed in a reasonable amount.  The prisoner then applied to the state court which declined to entertain the application.  Therefore the district court amended the initial order to provide that the prisoner would be released from custody on the posting of a bond of a designated amount with the state court.  On appeal the Third Circuit held that it was improper for the district court to order a state trial court to admit the petitioner to bail and remanded the case to the district court for a hearing as to the amount of any bond which would be deposited in the federal court as a condition of release.  Notwithstanding the language of Rule 23, the Third Circuit gave no indication that the district court was without power to modify the earlier order.  It observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equivalent of that Rule (Rule 23(c)) has been in effect since at least 1886.  In that year the Supreme Court adopted a rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>\"Ordered, That the following regulations be established under section 765 of the Revised Statutes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>RULE 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>CUSTODY OF PRISONERS ON HABEAS CORPUS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>3.  Pending an appeal from the final decision of any court or judge discharging the prisoner, he shall be enlarged upon recognizance, with surety, for appearance to answer the judgment of the appellate court, except where, for special reasons, sureties ought not to be required.\" 117 U.S. 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule or its equivalent has been a part of the rules of the Supreme Court ever since.  Its present equivalent is Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules.  The reference to Revised Statutes, &#167; 765 is to the statute which gave the Supreme Court general authority to regulate habeas corpus proceedings, including regulations \"for the custody and appearance of the person alleged to be restrained of his or her liberty.\"  Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, &#167; 1, 14 Stat. 385.  Rule 34 became Rule 42 in the 1925 Rules, 266 U.S. 685, Rule 45 in the 1928 Rules, 275 U.S. 629, and Rule 49 in the 1954 Rules, 346 U.S. 999.  Revised Statutes, &#167; 765 was repealed in the 1948 revision of title 28, but the statutory authority for Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules cannot be doubted.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2071 (rule making); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2101(f) (stays); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2251 (stays in habeas corpus cases); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651 (all writs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When in 1967 the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, it included in Rule 23 a rule identical in language with its own Rule 49.  Thus, Rule 23(c) is in direct succession from the original Supreme Court Rule 34(3) adopted in 1886.  Even though until 1967 it appeared in the Supreme Court rules, at all times it has dealt with the duty of the district courts in habeas corpus cases.  In 1886 the language requiring the enlargement of the successful habeas corpus petitioner was mandatory.  The only discretion was in deciding whether a surety on his recognizance ought to be required.  The mandatory language with respect to enlargement of the successful petitioner was carried forward until 1967.  In that year, however, Rule 49(3) was revised to provide that the successful petitioner \"shall be enlarged upon his recognizance, with or without surety, unless the court or justice or judge rendering the decision, or the court of appeals or this court, or a judge or justice of either court, shall otherwise order.\"  The revised language was carried into Rule 23(c), Fed.R.App.P.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus from 1886 to 1967 a judge granting habeas corpus relief was under a flat mandate to enlarge the petitioner pending appeal.  In United States ex rel. Collins v. Claudy, 204 F.2d 624 (3rd Cir. 1953) this court, reversing the denial of a habeas corpus petition and ordering that the writ issue, recognized that the state might seek a reversal in the Supreme Court.  It held, therefore,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>\". . . we will entertain a request for the enlargement of the petitioner on bail pending final disposition of this case if any further proceedings shall postpone the issuance of the mandate of this court in normal course.  See our Rule 15(3); Supreme Court Rule 45(3).\"  Id. at 630.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since 1967 an order such as was entered in the Collins case would not be mandatory.  But it is clear from the history of the rule prior to the 1967 change that there is still a very strong presumption that a petitioner holding a final judgment that his detention is unlawful should not be left in state custody.  The 1967 change was not intended to adopt a general rule in favor of custody pending appeal, but only to substitute discretion, to be exercised in limited situations, for what was formerly a mandatory release requirement.  See E. Bosky and E. Gressman, The 1967 Changes in the Supreme Court's Rules, 42 F.R.D. 139, 161 (1967).  There is no question, then, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>the district court had the power to order Thomas' enlargement from state custody pending the state's appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">472 F.2d at 742-43 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court rule which governed release of prisoners pending appeal in habeas corpus cases between 1954 and 1967 was more capable of the construction sought here by the state than the present rule.  Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules during that period stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>3.  Pending review of a decision discharging a prisoner on habeas corpus, he shall be enlarged upon recognizance, with surety, for his appearance to answer and abide by the judgment in the appellate proceeding; and if in the opinion of the court in which the case is pending, or of a judge or justice thereof, surety ought not to be required the personal recognizance of the prisoner shall suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">346 U.S. at 1000 (emphasis added).  Subsection 5 of the same rule indicated that the \"court in which the case is pending\" meant the appellate court, after a notice of appeal had been filed:5.  This rule applies only to cases arising or pending in courts of the United States.  For the purpose of this rule, a case is pending in the court possessed of the record until a notice of appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari has been filed, or until the time for such filing has expired, whichever is earlier; and is pending on review in the appellate court after the notice of appeal or the petition for writ of certiorari has been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, in Lewis v. Henderson, 356 F.2d 105 (6th Cir. 1966), our circuit tacitly indicated agreement with a district court determination that it was without jurisdiction under Rule 49(5) to release the petitioner on recognizance pending appeal after the notice of appeal had been filed.  See also Hash v. Henderson, 262 F.Supp. 1016 (E.D.Ark.), aff'd 385 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A contrary result, however, was reached by the Fifth Circuit in Jimenez v. Aristiguieta, 314 F.2d 649 (5th Cir. 1963), under this earlier version of the rule.  There a former chief executive of Venezuela contested a district court order revoking bail on the same day the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing a habeas corpus petition.  While observing that the order of revocation was in strict accordance with the original order of the district court and came after the appellate court had provided in its decision that the mandate was to be issued forthwith, the court of appeals did not hesitate to acknowledge the continuing authority of the district court to address questions concerning the petitioner's custody pending appeal and noted with approval numerous necessary modifications of the first order which had been entered by the district court during the process of the appeal. 314 F.2d at 651-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other decisions appear, at least by inference, to have recognized the authority in the district court to enter a custody order after an appeal has been noted.  E. g., Aronson v. May, 85 S.Ct. 3, 13 L.Ed.2d 6 (Douglas, Circuit Justice, 1964); United States ex rel. Barnwell v. Rundle, 461 F.2d 768 (3rd Cir. 1972); Byrd v. Smith, 407 F.2d 363 (5th Cir. 1969); O'Brien v. Lindsey, 202 F.2d 418 (1st Cir. 1953); United States ex rel. Paetau v. Watkins, 164 F.2d 457 (2d Cir. 1947); York ex rel. Davidescu v. Nicolls, 159 F.2d 147 (1st Cir. 1947); Smith v. Caldwell, 339 F.Supp. 215 (S.D.Ga.) aff'd mem., 458 F.2d 160 (5th Cir. 1972).  See R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice &#167; 17.15 at 563 (4th ed. 1969).  Similarly, other cases have implicitly indicated that the district court may enter more than one order concerning a prisoner's custody.  Aronson v. May, supra; United States ex rel. Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 105 F.Supp. 857 (E.D.N.Y.1952).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate question which will be decided in this court's ruling on the merits of the habeas corpus appeal will be Jones' freedom, and while in a very real sense the district court's June 24 order achieves the same immediate but tentative result, we do not see admission to bail as interfering with the appellate court's power of review.  In any event we believe that the application of any generalized rule must yield to the unique nature of habeas corpus proceedings.  In this regard we agree again with Judge Goodrich in Johnston v. Marsh, supra, 227 F.2d at 530:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>We think the basis of the judge's authority in this case is the fact that there is a prisoner before him over whom he has jurisdiction and where his power to act judicially is expressly conferred by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion by the district judge in his opinion that Rule 23 states a \"limitation on the discretion of appellate courts to modify initial orders\" rather than a limitation on the power of the district court to issue them has considerable merit and is a view which was recognized in Jimenez v. Aristiguieta, supra, 314 F.2d at 652.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this history and the express limitation upon the powers of Congress contained in Article I of the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> it seems to us that any uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the retained power of the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that Judge Battisti's construction of Rule 23(d) is consistent with the other subdivisions of the rule.  Rule 23(a) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Pending review of a decision in a habeas corpus proceeding commenced before a court, justice or judge of the United States for the release of a prisoner, a person having custody of the prisoner shall not transfer custody to another unless such transfer is directed in accordance with the provisions of this rule.  Upon application of a custodian showing a need therefore, the court, justice or judge rendering the decision may make an order authorizing transfer and providing for the substitution of the successor custodian as a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An understanding of this portion of the rule, in the light of habeas corpus law generally, shows that it was designed in part to preserve the district judge's power over the physical custody of the petitioner by prohibiting the custodian from transferring custody of the prisoner to another, without the authorization of the \"court, justice or judge rendering the decision.\"  The language in no manner implies that any power to make that decision is lost or transferred to the appellate court because of the pendency of the appeal.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 223.03 at 3505 (2d ed. 1975).  If, therefore, authority is retained in the district judge to make this decision, it is difficult to argue that it was lost with respect to other immediate problems concerning custody by the filing of the notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one authority has indicated that the 1967 amendments to Supreme Court Rule 49, which is the source of the exact language in Rule 23, Fed.R.App.P., were in fact intended to ensure that a district court could make custody orders after a notice of appeal had been filed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>A group of amendments to the various paragraphs of Rule 49 makes it possible for the court or Justice or judge who has heard the habeas corpus application to issue orders respecting custody or enlargement of the prisoner pending appeal.  Under the former provisions of Rule 49, once a notice of appeal was filed, such authority was vested solely in appellate courts or appellate judges or Justices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Boskey &amp; E. Gressman, \"The 1967 Changes in the Supreme Court's Rules,\" 42 F.R.D. 139, 160 (1968) (emphasis added).  The reference to \"orders\" respecting custody or enlargement pending appeal together with the deletion of the language of former Rule 49 convincingly demonstrates that the amendments were intended to retain in the district court power to issue orders respecting custody or enlargement of the petitioner at least until a party seeks a modification or change of such an order by motion in the court of appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petition denied without prejudice to a motion by the state to revoke petitioner's bail for \"special reasons\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

On February 15 Jones applied for bail, and on March 2 petitioner Jago filed a notice of appeal and moved for a stay of execution of the judgment.  The district court denied both the request for bail and the motion for a stay on March 7. Jago sought in this court a stay of the judgment, which was granted on April 19.  Upon a renewed application for bail, the district court on June 24, 1977 ordered Jones released pending the appeal on the condition that he post bail in the amount of $10,000, ten percent deposit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ordering Jones' release, District Judge Frank J.

He concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Under these circumstances, continued imprisonment of the petitioner by the state can no longer be justified.

At first blush this position appears to have much merit, especially in the light of the express language of Rule 23(d), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>An initial order respecting the custody or enlargement of the prisoner and any recognizance or surety taken, shall govern review in the court of appeals and in the Supreme Court unless for special reasons shown to the court of appeals or to the Supreme Court, or to a judge or justice of either court, the order shall be modified, or an independent order respecting custody, enlargement or surety shall be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon a literal reading of the rule, the state argues that the district judge's \"initial\" order denied release and thus must govern Jones' custody during appeal unless changed by the court of appeals for \"special reasons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the state relies upon the general proposition that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the district court of jurisdiction and transfers such jurisdiction to the court of appeals, citing the following Sixth Circuit cases: Oak Construction Co. v.

Thus the state contends that the district court acted without jurisdiction.  The earlier order denying bail, while also entered after the appeal was noted, is not subject to this defect, it urges, because an application had been made prior to the filing of the notice.  The state also correctly points out that habeas corpus petitioners are not subject to the provisions of Rule 9, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, pertaining to admission to bail of defendants in direct criminal appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering similar arguments in the district court, Judge Battisti concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The respondent interprets this rule (23(d)) to mean that modification of an initial order respecting custody is limited to the appellate courts.  But, clearly, this is a misreading of the provision.  Though the rule indicates the truism that on review in the court of appeals or the Supreme Court an order can only be modified by a judge or justice of that court, it neither states nor implies that the district court is divested of jurisdiction to modify or reconsider its orders concerning custody.  In fact this rule states a limitation on the discretion of appellate courts to modify initial orders and, thereby, reemphasizes the responsibility of the district court to determine the propriety of release pending appeal.  According to this rule, absent \"special reasons,\" the appellate courts are, in fact, to be governed by the rulings made by the lower courts regarding custody.  Hence, this court not only has jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's motion by virtue of Rule 23(c), but also has a special obligation to modify, if the circumstances require, an order which the court of appeals might otherwise consider binding by virtue of Rule 23(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Rule 23(c) states that a successful petitioner for habeas corpus \"shall be enlarged\" pending appeal, unless the court otherwise orders.

This is its fundamental nature even today.  Above all it deals with the issue of personal freedom from imposed restraints.  In its most literal terms, a writ commands a custodian to bring the aggrieved party into the presence of the judge issuing the writ and at that time to justify the detention.  Historically the judge then inquired into the custodian's reasons, and if he found them unlawful or inadequate, he ordered the immediate release of the person so held and the matter was closed.  Immediacy was and is its essence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>This is a high prerogative writ, and therefore by the common law issuing out of the court of the king's bench not only in term-time, but also during the vacation, by a fiat from the chief justice or any other of the judges, and running into all parts of the king's dominions: for the king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 W.

It is important to remember, however, that the prisoners in state correctional institutions are not the only potential beneficiaries of the writ or of the laws authorizing federal judges to issue it.  The Supreme Court has commented, \"It is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.\"  Jones v.

When a court with jurisdiction of the subject matter receives a petition for habeas corpus which is not inadequate on its face, normal procedure is to issue a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the person who is detaining the petitioner to bring him before the court for hearing and decision whether he is unlawfully deprived of his liberty.  The district court issued such an order here and in obedience thereto the state warden produced his prisoner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>At that juncture the body of the petitioner came under the lawful control of the district court.  In legal contemplation that control continues pending decision whether to free the petitioner or to return him to state custody.  During that period detention is by force of the writ of habeas corpus, and the antecedent detaining authority is superseded for the time being.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Normally, where the petitioner is a prisoner serving a sentence upon conviction of crime, the court before which he is brought by writ of habeas corpus directs the warden to hold him until the court can decide the case.  But this procedure is not in derogation of the controlling concept that the body is being held pendente lite under authority and subject to order of the court which has issued the writ.  Once this concept is recognized, it becomes clear that the particular interim disposition which the court makes of the body is a judicial function of that court to be discharged, absent any controlling statute, in the exercise of judicial discretion, all relevant circumstances considered.  The court is under no ministerial duty to direct or permit the person who produces the petitioner to continue to hold him during this period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnston v. Marsh typifies the problems concerning physical custody which must necessarily be faced in a very practical way by the habeas corpus judge where there is delay in reaching a disposition of the petitioner's case.  In Johnston the petitioner was admitted to bail pending disposition on the merits by the district court, where it was shown that he was an advanced diabetic and was, under the conditions of confinement, rapidly progressing toward total blindness.  The state prisoner thus required hospitalization, and the court conditioned the admission to bail upon his going to and remaining in a private hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Goodrich's opinion in Johnston traced to some extent the exercise of the authority to admit to bail in habeas corpus cases, pending decision on the merits, as recognized in England and in the United States:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>One of the inherent powers of the judiciary with regard to proceedings before it has been the admission of a prisoner to bail where, in the exercise of his discretion, the judge deems it advisable.  It is clear that at common law courts had the inherent power to grant bail.  See, e. g., Queen v. Spilsbury, (1898) 2 Q.B. 615, 620.  This authority was exercised in habeas corpus cases pending decision on the merits.

Curran, 2 Cir., 1924, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></span>, 954, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>; United States v.

Yet whether Federal courts have this authority has been the subject of considerable controversy.  The principal cases are compiled in Principe v. Ault, D.C.N.D.Ohio 1945, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596271\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596271/principe-v-ault/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 281.  On apparently the only occasion at which this question has been presented to it, the Supreme Court, in dicta, said that it was unwilling to hold that circuit courts do not have this inherent power.  Wright v. Henkel, 1903, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95882\"><a href=\"/opinion/95882/wright-v-henkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95882\"><a href=\"/opinion/95882/wright-v-henkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>.  We believe that the basic misconception in those decisions denying this authority lies in their view that since Federal courts have limited, statutory jurisdiction, their powers in proceedings involving this jurisdiction are necessarily limited and must be statutory.  See Principe v. Ault, D.C.N.D.Ohio 1945, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596271\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596271/principe-v-ault/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This, as already indicated, is not our view of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">227 F.2d at 531 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule that an appeal to the circuit court deprives the district court of jurisdiction as to any matters involved in the appeal is neither \"a creature of statute\" nor \"absolute in character.\"  Hoffman v. Beer Drivers &amp; Salesmen's Local Union 888, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336257\"><a href=\"/opinion/336257/roy-o-hoffman-regional-director-of-region-20-of-the-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span>, 1276 (9th Cir. 1976).  Contrary to the contention of the state, the question concerning physical custody of the defendant pending review does not affect the matters involved in the appeal itself.  The habeas petitioner is not physically transferred to the appellate court, though the issues concerning his petition are presented there.  The order from which the appeal is taken provided that because of a constitutional violation in his state court trial, the petitioner should be granted the writ unless the state retried him in ninety days.  This decision did not in any way relate to or concern the matter of his custody pending the appeal, although his personal freedom was at issue in each instance.  In this respect, the case is not unlike many others in which the district court has of necessity a retained power to act even though a judgment in the case may be the subject of a pending appeal.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 203.11 at 734-35 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hogg v. United States, supra, we recognized that a district court continues to have jurisdiction to act in aid of the appeal as authorized under the federal rules. 411 F.2d at 580.  Certainly if the physical welfare of the petitioner is the responsibility of the district court during the appeal and if the question of his custody does not affect the merits of the appeal itself, it is not unreasonable to believe that there is a retained power in the district court to aid the appeal by undertaking that responsibility, at least in the absence of its exercise by an appellate court.  In Hoffman v. Beer Drivers, supra, the Ninth Circuit went so far as to permit the district court's alteration of a preliminary injunction in a labor dispute even though that very injunction was then pending in the court of appeals.  The court reasoned that because there was a continuing necessity to maintain a status quo in light of new facts which developed after the entry of the original order, the district court ought to be allowed to retain supervisory control as the circumstances dictated. 536 F.2d at 1276.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar responsibility for custody decisions is reserved in the district court for direct criminal appeals by the express provisions of Rule 9(b), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Release pending an appeal must be first sought in the district court even after an appeal has been noted from the judgment of conviction.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 209.01(2) at 1504, P 209.06 at 1512 (2d ed. 1975).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We believe that a proper understanding of the history of Rule 23 supports a conclusion that it, also, preserves in the district judge authority to issue one or more orders regarding the custody or enlargement of a prisoner pending the review of the decision in the habeas corpus action.  The district court does not lose his jurisdiction when an appeal is noted from the decision.  However, on motion by a party, the court of appeals or a single judge of the court may modify any such order, or make an independent custody order, but only where \"special reasons\" are found to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good summary of the history of Rule 23, particularly subdivision (c) which is applicable in this case, is found in United States ex rel.

There the district court had granted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner and ordered that if no appeal was taken by the state and no retrial was begun within 60 days, the petitioner was to be released.  The order also stated that during the pending appeal the state county court was to entertain an application for bail by the petitioner, which was to be fixed in a reasonable amount.  The prisoner then applied to the state court which declined to entertain the application.  Therefore the district court amended the initial order to provide that the prisoner would be released from custody on the posting of a bond of a designated amount with the state court.  On appeal the Third Circuit held that it was improper for the district court to order a state trial court to admit the petitioner to bail and remanded the case to the district court for a hearing as to the amount of any bond which would be deposited in the federal court as a condition of release.  Notwithstanding the language of Rule 23, the Third Circuit gave no indication that the district court was without power to modify the earlier order.  It observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equivalent of that Rule (Rule 23(c)) has been in effect since at least 1886.

Its present equivalent is Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules.  The reference to Revised Statutes, &#167; 765 is to the statute which gave the Supreme Court general authority to regulate habeas corpus proceedings, including regulations \"for the custody and appearance of the person alleged to be restrained of his or her liberty.\"  Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, &#167; 1, 14 Stat. 385.  Rule 34 became Rule 42 in the 1925 Rules, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span>, Rule 45 in the 1928 Rules, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></span>, and Rule 49 in the 1954 Rules, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></span>.  Revised Statutes, &#167; 765 was repealed in the 1948 revision of title 28, but the statutory authority for Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules cannot be doubted.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2071 (rule making); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2101(f) (stays); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2251 (stays in habeas corpus cases); 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651 (all writs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When in 1967 the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, it included in Rule 23 a rule identical in language with its own Rule 49.  Thus, Rule 23(c) is in direct succession from the original Supreme Court Rule 34(3) adopted in 1886.  Even though until 1967 it appeared in the Supreme Court rules, at all times it has dealt with the duty of the district courts in habeas corpus cases.  In 1886 the language requiring the enlargement of the successful habeas corpus petitioner was mandatory.  The only discretion was in deciding whether a surety on his recognizance ought to be required.  The mandatory language with respect to enlargement of the successful petitioner was carried forward until 1967.  In that year, however, Rule 49(3) was revised to provide that the successful petitioner \"shall be enlarged upon his recognizance, with or without surety, unless the court or justice or judge rendering the decision, or the court of appeals or this court, or a judge or justice of either court, shall otherwise order.\"  The revised language was carried into Rule 23(c), Fed.R.App.P.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus from 1886 to 1967 a judge granting habeas corpus relief was under a flat mandate to enlarge the petitioner pending appeal.  In United States ex rel. Collins v. Claudy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"231795\"><a href=\"/opinion/231795/united-states-ex-rel-collins-v-claudy-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span> (3rd Cir. 1953) this court, reversing the denial of a habeas corpus petition and ordering that the writ issue, recognized that the state might seek a reversal in the Supreme Court.  It held, therefore,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>\". . . we will entertain a request for the enlargement of the petitioner on bail pending final disposition of this case if any further proceedings shall postpone the issuance of the mandate of this court in normal course.

But it is clear from the history of the rule prior to the 1967 change that there is still a very strong presumption that a petitioner holding a final judgment that his detention is unlawful should not be left in state custody.  The 1967 change was not intended to adopt a general rule in favor of custody pending appeal, but only to substitute discretion, to be exercised in limited situations, for what was formerly a mandatory release requirement.  See E. Bosky and E. Gressman, The 1967 Changes in the Supreme Court's Rules, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span>, 161 (1967).

Rule 49(3) of the Supreme Court Rules during that period stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>3.  Pending review of a decision discharging a prisoner on habeas corpus, he shall be enlarged upon recognizance, with surety, for his appearance to answer and abide by the judgment in the appellate proceeding; and if in the opinion of the court in which the case is pending, or of a judge or justice thereof, surety ought not to be required the personal recognizance of the prisoner shall suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">346 U.S. at 1000 (emphasis added).  Subsection 5 of the same rule indicated that the \"court in which the case is pending\" meant the appellate court, after a notice of appeal had been filed:5.  This rule applies only to cases arising or pending in courts of the United States.  For the purpose of this rule, a case is pending in the court possessed of the record until a notice of appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari has been filed, or until the time for such filing has expired, whichever is earlier; and is pending on review in the appellate court after the notice of appeal or the petition for writ of certiorari has been filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.

There a former chief executive of Venezuela contested a district court order revoking bail on the same day the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's order dismissing a habeas corpus petition.  While observing that the order of revocation was in strict accordance with the original order of the district court and came after the appellate court had provided in its decision that the mandate was to be issued forthwith, the court of appeals did not hesitate to acknowledge the continuing authority of the district court to address questions concerning the petitioner's custody pending appeal and noted with approval numerous necessary modifications of the first order which had been entered by the district court during the process of the appeal. 314 F.2d at 651-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other decisions appear, at least by inference, to have recognized the authority in the district court to enter a custody order after an appeal has been noted.

See R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice &#167; 17.15 at 563 (4th ed. 1969).  Similarly, other cases have implicitly indicated that the district court may enter more than one order concerning a prisoner's custody.  Aronson v. May, supra; United States ex rel. Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></span> (E.D.N.Y.1952).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate question which will be decided in this court's ruling on the merits of the habeas corpus appeal will be Jones' freedom, and while in a very real sense the district court's June 24 order achieves the same immediate but tentative result, we do not see admission to bail as interfering with the appellate court's power of review.  In any event we believe that the application of any generalized rule must yield to the unique nature of habeas corpus proceedings.  In this regard we agree again with Judge Goodrich in Johnston v. Marsh, supra, 227 F.2d at 530:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>We think the basis of the judge's authority in this case is the fact that there is a prisoner before him over whom he has jurisdiction and where his power to act judicially is expressly conferred by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion by the district judge in his opinion that Rule 23 states a \"limitation on the discretion of appellate courts to modify initial orders\" rather than a limitation on the power of the district court to issue them has considerable merit and is a view which was recognized in Jimenez v. Aristiguieta, supra, 314 F.2d at 652.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this history and the express limitation upon the powers of Congress contained in Article I of the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> it seems to us that any uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the retained power of the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also believe that Judge Battisti's construction of Rule 23(d) is consistent with the other subdivisions of the rule.  Rule 23(a) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>Pending review of a decision in a habeas corpus proceeding commenced before a court, justice or judge of the United States for the release of a prisoner, a person having custody of the prisoner shall not transfer custody to another unless such transfer is directed in accordance with the provisions of this rule.  Upon application of a custodian showing a need therefore, the court, justice or judge rendering the decision may make an order authorizing transfer and providing for the substitution of the successor custodian as a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An understanding of this portion of the rule, in the light of habeas corpus law generally, shows that it was designed in part to preserve the district judge's power over the physical custody of the petitioner by prohibiting the custodian from transferring custody of the prisoner to another, without the authorization of the \"court, justice or judge rendering the decision.\"  The language in no manner implies that any power to make that decision is lost or transferred to the appellate court because of the pendency of the appeal.  See 9 Moore's Federal Practice P 223.03 at 3505 (2d ed. 1975).  If, therefore, authority is retained in the district judge to make this decision, it is difficult to argue that it was lost with respect to other immediate problems concerning custody by the filing of the notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, one authority has indicated that the 1967 amendments to Supreme Court Rule 49, which is the source of the exact language in Rule 23, Fed.R.App.P., were in fact intended to ensure that a district court could make custody orders after a notice of appeal had been filed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>A group of amendments to the various paragraphs of Rule 49 makes it possible for the court or Justice or judge who has heard the habeas corpus application to issue orders respecting custody or enlargement of the prisoner pending appeal.  Under the former provisions of Rule 49, once a notice of appeal was filed, such authority was vested solely in appellate courts or appellate judges or Justices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The reference to \"orders\" respecting custody or enlargement pending appeal together with the deletion of the language of former Rule 49 convincingly demonstrates that the amendments were intended to retain in the district court power to issue orders respecting custody or enlargement of the petitioner at least until a party seeks a modification or change of such an order by motion in the court of appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petition denied without prejudice to a motion by the state to revoke petitioner's bail for \"special reasons\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

They also appeal the district court's dismissal on the grounds of judicial immunity of their similar claims against a bankruptcy judge and a bankruptcy trustee.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Coskun and Beverly Ateser retained attorney Gerald Bopp to represent them in a state court lawsuit in Mason County, Washington.  In January of 1988, Bopp and another attorney, Leland Bull, advised the Atesers that they could stay the trial in the state action by filing for bankruptcy in federal court.  The Atesers filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on February 5, 1988.  The case was assigned to Bankruptcy Judge Sidney Volinn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1988, the opposing party in the state court action moved for relief from the bankruptcy stay.  Judge Volinn granted the motion and the state court action went to trial in Mason County.  In August 1988, the state court awarded a judgment of $325,000 against the Atesers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Volinn appointed Robert Steinberg as bankruptcy trustee for the Atesers in December 1988.  The Atesers changed attorneys in April 1989, substituting James Dickmeyer of Sinsheimer &amp; Meltzer.  Pursuant to bankruptcy court orders, Steinberg sold the Atesers' residence on Lake Washington, sold another property of the Atesers' (the Hood Canal property), and approved payment of $37,800 for federal income taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steinberg then submitted a reorganization plan for payment from the bankruptcy estate of legal fees and costs.  The bankruptcy court approved the plan in September 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of the bankruptcy case, the Atesers filed a lawsuit in federal district court in the Western District of Washington, against their initial attorneys Bopp and Bull;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  the bankruptcy trustee, Steinberg;  the trustee's attorney, Daniel Forsch (who is not named in this appeal);  James Dickmeyer and the Sinsheimer &amp; Meltzer law firm (\"Sinsheimer defendants\");  and Bankruptcy Judge Volinn.  The Atesers filed a First Amended Complaint (\"complaint\") on July 13, 1992.  The complaint alleged twenty-two causes of action, including violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962 (1988);  mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1988);  wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (1988);  bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 152, 153, and 155 (1988);  and seventeen pendent state claims.  The gist of the complaint was that the defendants had conspired to waste the Atesers' assets in the bankruptcy proceeding.  Among other demands, the Atesers asked for $10 million in special damages for lost wages and income, $40 million in general damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering, treble damages, and damages pursuant to state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state claims.  On September 30, 1992, the court granted the Sinsheimer defendants' motion to dismiss all but the RICO claims for failure to state a claim, and granted the Sinsheimer defendants summary judgment on the RICO claims.  On November 4, 1992, the court granted Judge Volinn's and Steinberg's summary judgment motions on the grounds of judicial immunity.  The Atesers appeal these judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>I. Causes of action under the criminal statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the causes of action against the Sinsheimer defendants under the mail, wire, and bankruptcy fraud statutes, finding that the complaint failed to state a federal claim for relief because there was no private right of action under any of these criminal statutes.  We review the district court's dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) de novo.   Buckey v. County of Los Angeles, 968 F.2d 791, 793-94 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 599 (1992).  Review is limited to the contents of the complaint.

An evaluation of the other elements is not necessary if the court finds that Congress did not intend to create a private right of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stupy v. United States Postal Serv., 951 F.2d 1079, 1081 (9th Cir.1991) (citing  Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975)).  It is especially difficult to find an implied civil cause of action in \"a bare criminal statute, with absolutely no indication that civil enforcement of any kind was available to anyone.\"   Cort, 422 U.S. at 80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have consistently found that the mail and wire fraud statutes do not confer private rights of action.   See, e.g., Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank, 815 F.2d 522, 533 n. 1 (9th Cir.1987) (Boochever, J., dissenting) (citing  Ryan v. Ohio Edison Co., 611 F.2d 1170, 1177-79 (6th Cir.1979) (paucity of legislative history or any other evidence showing intent to create private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 means other Cort factors need not be addressed), and  Bell v. Health-Mor, Inc., 549 F.2d 342, 344-45 (5th Cir.1977));   Napper v. Anderson, 500 F.2d 634, 636 (5th Cir.1974) (like mail fraud statute, no Congressional intent to create federal cause of action for damages under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 prohibiting wire fraud), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 837 (1975).  Ateser cites no contrary federal authority, nor has our research unearthed such a holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy fraud statutes are likewise criminal statutes providing criminal penalties for the fraudulent concealment of assets belonging to the estate from an officer of the bankruptcy court, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 152, embezzlement by a trustee in bankruptcy, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 153, and agreements between parties in interest to fix fees or other compensation, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 155.  Their language does not evince an intent to create a civil action for damages, and the legislative history of the provisions does not demonstrate that such actions were contemplated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers do not address the factors in Cort or discuss legislative intent or purpose.  In fact, they do not even engage in any analysis of whether or why a private right of action exists under these particular statutes.  Instead, they argue that dismissal of their civil action denies them their constitutional right under the first amendment to petition the government for redress of grievances.  According to the Atesers, every federal criminal statute implicates their constitutional rights, and because Congress cannot do away with a citizen's right to petition for enforcement of a constitutional right, they are entitled to sue under those statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers' logic would create an automatic private right of action under every criminal statute.  As the district court stated:  \"Th[is] is a novel argument but it is not one, in my judgment, that has legal or constitutional support.\"   See Gordon v. Heimann, 514 F.Supp. 659, 661 (N.D.Ga.1980) (right to petition does not imply duty of government to act to redress every grievance).  The district court did not err in dismissing the mail, wire, and bankruptcy fraud causes of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers also claim they should have been allowed to amend their complaint.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) requires a plaintiff to ask for leave to amend, following one amendment as of right.  The Atesers had already amended the complaint once, and did not request leave to file a second amended complaint.  Thus, they are in no position to object in this court.  Even if they had, it would have been within the court's discretion to deny the request.  In any case, any amendment could not have cured the fatal defect of the lack of a private right of action under the criminal statutes.   See Hinton v.

T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 629 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers' complaint alleges that \"Defendants are enterprises engaged in activities which affect interstate commerce,\" listing Steinberg, Dickmeyer and Judge Volinn as \"persons ... and/or an enterprise ... who conducted and participated, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of said enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962(b).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint states that the predicate acts constituting the alleged pattern of racketeering \"are set out in subparagraphs herein.\"   The 44-page complaint contains almost 130 subparagraphs, which assign as \"predicate acts\" nearly every action undertaken by the defendants in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sinsheimer defendants submitted a long affidavit from Dickmeyer, painstakingly stating that the \"predicate acts\" the Atesers alleged he committed were undertaken in good faith in the course of his representation.  The Atesers submitted no affidavits or declarations.  The complaint is not verified, so it may not counter Dickmeyer's affidavit and establish a genuine issue of material fact.   See Lew v. Kona Hosp., 754 F.2d 1420, 1423 (9th Cir.1985) (unverified complaint insufficient to be treated as countering affidavit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers argue that Dickmeyer's affidavit fails to foreclose the possibility that a jury might infer predicate acts from some of the allegations in the complaint.  Following the moving party's demonstration by affidavit that there was no material issue of fact, however, the Atesers \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"   Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  There is \"no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials negating the opponent's claim.\"   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  The Atesers must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial under the RICO statute.   See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.  They have not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers also claim that even if they did not allege facts material to proving that Dickmeyer himself committed predicate acts, he and his law firm could be liable if they consciously avoided knowledge of the illegal purpose of those associated with the bankruptcy proceeding.  Such a theory requires facts in evidence supporting an inference of deliberate ignorance.   United States v. McAllister, 747 F.2d 1273, 1275 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 829 (1985).   See also United States v. Caliendo, 910 F.2d 429, 434 (7th Cir.1990) (approving \"ostrich\" instruction in RICO case to show scienter where the defendant admits participation but claims lack of guilty knowledge of the illegal purpose of the activity).  The Atesers point to no specific facts indicating deliberate ignorance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Atesers' claim that the district court erred in failing to find that Dickmeyer's affidavit was made in bad faith pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(g) is not properly before the panel, as the Atesers never made a Rule 56(g) motion in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the Atesers presented no genuine issue of material fact regarding RICO predicate acts.  We therefore do not address whether they presented a material question of fact as to the existence of a RICO enterprise.  We also find that the district court properly refused to postpone summary judgment pending further discovery, as the Atesers did not request a continuance under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), nor did they file affidavits showing the particular facts they expected to find through further discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>III. Claims against the bankruptcy judge and trustee</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the complaint against Judge Volinn and bankruptcy trustee Steinberg on the grounds of judicial immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judges are generally immune from suit for money damages.   Mireles v. Waco, 112 S.Ct. 286, 287 (1991) (per curiam).  That immunity protects judges against suits, not merely damages, and \"is not overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice.\"   Id. at 288.  Judges lose their immunity only for actions not taken in a judicial capacity, or judicial actions taken in the complete absence of any jurisdiction.  Id.  Immunity attaches for any function normally performed by a judge.   Id. at 288-89.  Policy considerations favor a broad construction of immunity.   JNC Cos. v. Ollason, 137 B.R. 46, 50 (D.Ariz.1991), aff'd, 996 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The immunity of Steinberg (the bankruptcy trustee) is derived from the judge who appointed him, and Steinberg is similarly immune unless he acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.   Mullis v. United States Bankr.  Court, 828 F.2d 1385, 1390 (9th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1040 (1988).  A trustee, however, may be liable for intentional or negligent violations of legal duties.   Bennett v. Williams, 892 F.2d 822, 823 (9th Cir.1989).  Before immunity will attach, the trustee should obtain court approval and give notice to the debtor of proposed actions within official duties.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers do not address the nature of the individual actions of the judge or trustee.  Instead, they base their claim that immunity did not attach on their own admission that the bankruptcy proceeding which they instituted was a \"sham,\" undertaken to avoid judgment in the state court action.  They apparently claim that because they filed as \"non-debtors,\" the bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction.  They are mistaken.  There is no requirement that an individual filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 be a debtor or financially unhealthy.  See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 109(b), (d);   In re Stolrow's Inc., 84 B.R. 167, 171 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1988).  Even if the Atesers were found to have filed in bad faith, the bankruptcy judge would still have jurisdiction over their action.   Stolrow's, 84 B.R. at 170-71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find immunity was properly granted to Judge Volinn.  Similarly, the evidence submitted indicates that Steinberg, as trustee, acted with court approval and within his bankruptcy duties.  Steinberg had orders from the bankruptcy court approving his sale of the Atesers' residence and their Hood Canal property, and his payment of the income taxes.  The Atesers do not allege that they failed to receive notice of all his actions.  Steinberg's uncontroverted affidavit states that he always acted within his official duty and pursuant to court order or the Bankruptcy Code.  Accordingly, both Judge Volinn and Steinberg are immune from the Atesers' suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>IV. Sanctions on appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1912</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sinsheimer defendants request fees under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1912, which in conjunction with Fed.R.App.P. 38 authorizes an award of attorney's fees and costs to the appellees when the appellant's contentions are without merit and the results are obvious.   Gaskell v. Weir, 10 F.3d 626, 629 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, the Atesers' contentions on appeal regarding the existence of a private right of action are without merit.  Their claims fail even when framed in the proper legal arguments;  further, the arguments they did make were often irrelevant.   See Hartz v. Friedman, 919 F.2d 469, 475 (7th Cir.1990) (court must evaluate arguments actually made on appeal when considering sanctions).  The district court made its reasons for the ruling on the private right of action issue abundantly clear.  The Atesers could have no reasonable expectation that their arguments would convince this court to change the district court's findings.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, in view of their failure to file any affidavit in response to Dickmeyer's affidavit, we find the Atesers' contentions on appeal to be frivolous.  We order the payment of $2,000 to the Sinsheimer defendants for fees and costs on appeal.  This award is made jointly and severally against the Atesers and their counsel.   See International Union of Bricklayers v. Martin Jaska, Inc., 752 F.2d 1401, 1407 n. 8 (9th Cir.1985) (court has inherent power to impose sanctions on attorney and client jointly and severally, who are between them in best position to determine who caused frivolous appeal to be taken).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM the decision of the district court, and award sanctions in the amount of $2,000 to the Sinsheimer defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.R. 36-3</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Atesers' appeal of the district court's decision in their case against Bull was dismissed for failure to prosecute on January 13, 1994 (No. 93-35101)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As they did not raise the issue in their complaint, we do not address the Atesers' allegations on appeal concerning the United States Attorney's failure to prosecute and alleged conflicts of interest</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Atesers cite 18 U.S.C.

They also appeal the district court's dismissal on the grounds of judicial immunity of their similar claims against a bankruptcy judge and a bankruptcy trustee.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Coskun and Beverly Ateser retained attorney Gerald Bopp to represent them in a state court lawsuit in Mason County, Washington.  In January of 1988, Bopp and another attorney, Leland Bull, advised the Atesers that they could stay the trial in the state action by filing for bankruptcy in federal court.  The Atesers filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on February 5, 1988.  The case was assigned to Bankruptcy Judge Sidney Volinn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1988, the opposing party in the state court action moved for relief from the bankruptcy stay.  Judge Volinn granted the motion and the state court action went to trial in Mason County.  In August 1988, the state court awarded a judgment of $325,000 against the Atesers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Volinn appointed Robert Steinberg as bankruptcy trustee for the Atesers in December 1988.  The Atesers changed attorneys in April 1989, substituting James Dickmeyer of Sinsheimer &amp; Meltzer.  Pursuant to bankruptcy court orders, Steinberg sold the Atesers' residence on Lake Washington, sold another property of the Atesers' (the Hood Canal property), and approved payment of $37,800 for federal income taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steinberg then submitted a reorganization plan for payment from the bankruptcy estate of legal fees and costs.  The bankruptcy court approved the plan in September 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of the bankruptcy case, the Atesers filed a lawsuit in federal district court in the Western District of Washington, against their initial attorneys Bopp and Bull;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  the bankruptcy trustee, Steinberg;  the trustee's attorney, Daniel Forsch (who is not named in this appeal);  James Dickmeyer and the Sinsheimer &amp; Meltzer law firm (\"Sinsheimer defendants\");  and Bankruptcy Judge Volinn.  The Atesers filed a First Amended Complaint (\"complaint\") on July 13, 1992.  The complaint alleged twenty-two causes of action, including violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1962 (1988);  mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1341 (1988);  wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (1988);  bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. Secs. 152, 153, and 155 (1988);  and seventeen pendent state claims.  The gist of the complaint was that the defendants had conspired to waste the Atesers' assets in the bankruptcy proceeding.  Among other demands, the Atesers asked for $10 million in special damages for lost wages and income, $40 million in general damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering, treble damages, and damages pursuant to state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state claims.  On September 30, 1992, the court granted the Sinsheimer defendants' motion to dismiss all but the RICO claims for failure to state a claim, and granted the Sinsheimer defendants summary judgment on the RICO claims.  On November 4, 1992, the court granted Judge Volinn's and Steinberg's summary judgment motions on the grounds of judicial immunity.  The Atesers appeal these judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>I.

Sec. 152, embezzlement by a trustee in bankruptcy, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 153, and agreements between parties in interest to fix fees or other compensation, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 155.

In fact, they do not even engage in any analysis of whether or why a private right of action exists under these particular statutes.  Instead, they argue that dismissal of their civil action denies them their constitutional right under the first amendment to petition the government for redress of grievances.  According to the Atesers, every federal criminal statute implicates their constitutional rights, and because Congress cannot do away with a citizen's right to petition for enforcement of a constitutional right, they are entitled to sue under those statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers' logic would create an automatic private right of action under every criminal statute.  As the district court stated:  \"Th[is] is a novel argument but it is not one, in my judgment, that has legal or constitutional support.\"   See Gordon v. Heimann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1961937\"><a href=\"/opinion/1961937/gordon-v-heimann/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 661 (N.D.Ga.1980) (right to petition does not imply duty of government to act to redress every grievance).  The district court did not err in dismissing the mail, wire, and bankruptcy fraud causes of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atesers also claim they should have been allowed to amend their complaint.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) requires a plaintiff to ask for leave to amend, following one amendment as of right.  The Atesers had already amended the complaint once, and did not request leave to file a second amended complaint.  Thus, they are in no position to object in this court.  Even if they had, it would have been within the court's discretion to deny the request.  In any case, any amendment could not have cured the fatal defect of the lack of a private right of action under the criminal statutes.   See Hinton v.

The Atesers submitted no affidavits or declarations.  The complaint is not verified, so it may not counter Dickmeyer's affidavit and establish a genuine issue of material fact.   See Lew v.

We therefore do not address whether they presented a material question of fact as to the existence of a RICO enterprise.  We also find that the district court properly refused to postpone summary judgment pending further discovery, as the Atesers did not request a continuance under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), nor did they file affidavits showing the particular facts they expected to find through further discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>III.

Judges lose their immunity only for actions not taken in a judicial capacity, or judicial actions taken in the complete absence of any jurisdiction.  Id.  Immunity attaches for any function normally performed by a judge.   Id. at 288-89.  Policy considerations favor a broad construction of immunity.   JNC Cos. v.

Instead, they base their claim that immunity did not attach on their own admission that the bankruptcy proceeding which they instituted was a \"sham,\" undertaken to avoid judgment in the state court action.  They apparently claim that because they filed as \"non-debtors,\" the bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction.  They are mistaken.  There is no requirement that an individual filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 be a debtor or financially unhealthy.  See 11 U.S.C. Sec. 109(b), (d);   In re Stolrow's Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1899680\"><a href=\"/opinion/1899680/in-re-stolrows-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 171 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1988).  Even if the Atesers were found to have filed in bad faith, the bankruptcy judge would still have jurisdiction over their action.

Similarly, the evidence submitted indicates that Steinberg, as trustee, acted with court approval and within his bankruptcy duties.  Steinberg had orders from the bankruptcy court approving his sale of the Atesers' residence and their Hood Canal property, and his payment of the income taxes.  The Atesers do not allege that they failed to receive notice of all his actions.  Steinberg's uncontroverted affidavit states that he always acted within his official duty and pursuant to court order or the Bankruptcy Code.  Accordingly, both Judge Volinn and Steinberg are immune from the Atesers' suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>IV.

While the case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court changed the standard of employer liability for sexual harassment perpetrated by a supervisor.  See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998).  Shaw argues that because the district court applied the wrong liability standard to her case, this court should vacate summary judgment.  AutoZone counters that the record supports the affirmative defense recognized in Ellerth.  See 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  Because the undisputed facts establish that AutoZone is entitled to the Ellerth affirmative defense, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

AutoZone is an automotive parts retailer with many stores nationwide.  The store manager in Rock Falls was Donald Noble.  Noble's supervisor was Area Advisor Dave Hunsche; Hunsche's supervisor was District Manager Steve Lang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shaw submitted an employment application to Noble at the Rock Falls store.  Noble sent the application to Steve Dauw, a recruiter who then reviewed the application along with other people in AutoZone's management.  Noble was asked for his input in the hiring process, but Dauw conducted the employment interview and offered Shaw the job.

In addition to adopting this sexual harassment policy and distributing it to its employees, AutoZone periodically provides training sessions for its managers concerning its sexual harassment policies and AutoZone's guidelines.  Don Noble testified in his deposition that over the course of his employment with AutoZone, he attended approximately twenty management meetings which included training or conversations on AutoZone's sexual harassment policies and procedures and the handling of sexual harassment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Shaw, Noble began making comments about her physical attributes within her first week of employment with AutoZone.  In mid-May 1995, Shaw claims the comments became more explicit with Noble asking her questions about her sex life, including inquiries about whether Shaw masturbated.  Noble discussed pornographic movies and suggested ways for her to have better sex with her husband.  Shaw also testified that Noble had told her that he had told Wroy Kizer, another store manager, that Shaw and another female employee were part of his \"harem.\"  Shaw stated that Noble continued to make sexual comments until she quit on June 6, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her deposition, Shaw testified that she quit for \"[a] lot of different reasons,\" \"my uncomfortableness about being around Don,\" as well as \"the lack of support from Don as a manager, letting the employees take advantage of me or not support[ing] me.\"  Shaw also stated in her deposition that she quit because she was scheduled to have the day off on Thursday and \"they were going to make me give up my Thursday off and Don would not close the store....\" She quit by throwing her keys at Noble and telling him with profanity what he could do with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While working at AutoZone, Shaw did not report Noble's conduct to anyone nor did she tell Noble to stop making the offensive comments.  After Shaw quit, Hunsche, the Area Advisor, attempted to contact Shaw three times to conduct an exit interview, but Shaw did not return his phone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Instead, after exhausting her administrative remedies, Shaw filed suit alleging sexual harassment claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. sec.sec.2000e to 2000e-15, against both AutoZone and Noble.  Shaw also alleged a claim against Noble for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The parties stipulated to the dismissal of the two claims against Noble individually, leaving only the claim of sexual harassment against AutoZone.  AutoZone moved for summary judgment on that claim.  On September 19, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment to AutoZone on the basis of our decision in Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F.3d 490, 493 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc), which held that in a case of hostile work environment sexual harassment by a supervisor, the standard for the employer's liability is negligence.  The district court found that AutoZone was not negligent because it promulgated a sexual harassment policy and because Shaw had failed to notify anyone at AutoZone of Noble's conduct.  Shaw filed a timely notice of appeal, but this court stayed briefing pending the Supreme Court's decision in Ellerth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences from the facts in favor of the nonmovant.  See Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Illinois, Inc., 163 F.3d 1027, 1032 (7th Cir.1998).  Summary judgment is appropriate only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"We may affirm on any ground for which there is support in the record.\"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1032.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ellerth, the Supreme Court held that employers are strictly liable for a supervisor's sexual harassment of a subordinate, but that employers may avoid that liability by proving an affirmative defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.  When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed.  Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c).  The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.  While proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedures is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense.  And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing any unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Noble is a \"supervisor\" as that term is used in Ellerth, because AutoZone presented evidence that Noble lacked the authority to hire, fire or promote employees.  See Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1034 (\"[T]he essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim's employment.  This authority primarily consists of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline an employee.  Absent an entrustment of at least some of this authority, an employee does not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of imputing liability to the employer.\").  However, we need not decide that issue because, for purposes of summary judgment, AutoZone does not contest Noble's status as a \"supervisor.\"  Instead, AutoZone asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment based on the Ellerth affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Shaw did not suffer any tangible employment action, AutoZone may assert the Ellerth affirmative defense.  To avoid liability AutoZone must first prove that it exercised \"reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior....\" Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  While not required as a matter of law, id., the existence of an appropriate anti-harassment policy will often satisfy this first prong, see Scrivner v. Socorro Indep.  Sch. Dist., 169 F.3d 969, 971 (5th Cir.1999), because \" 'Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of anti-harassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.' \"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1037 (quoting Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, AutoZone adopted an antiharassment policy which it distributed to each of its employees.  While Shaw testified in her deposition that she had never seen AutoZone's sexual harassment policy, that is irrelevant because it is undisputed that she received a copy of the policy and that she was required as a condition of her employment to read and comply with both the policy and the other terms contained in the Employee Handbook.  She even signed an acknowledgment form stating \"I understand it is my responsibility to read and learn the policies and procedures contained in the AutoZone Handbook and Safety Booklet.\"  Under these circumstances, even if Shaw did not have actual knowledge of the policy, she had constructive knowledge of the anti-harassment policy.  Cf. Betaco, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 32 F.3d 1126, 1136 (7th Cir.1994) (\"As a result of [the duty to read the contract] a person who signs a written contract is bound by its terms regardless of his or her failure to read and understand its terms.\"); 24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. The Superior Court of Sonoma County, 66 Cal.App.4th 1199, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 533 (1998) (employee bound by terms of handbook where she signed a form acknowledging she received and read the handbook, even though she now claims she did not read the handbook).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This anti-harassment policy made clear AutoZone's stand that sexual harassment will not be tolerated, and provided for multiple mechanisms for the prompt resolution of complaints.  It is both specific and detailed, and it allows the \"complainant to circumvent the supervisory chain of command.\"  Jansen, 123 F.3d at 498 (Flaum, J., concurring).  \"Rather than criticize, we should encourage any employer who constructs multiple mechanisms for detecting and correcting harassment.\"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1037.  In addition to distributing this policy to its employees, AutoZone regularly conducted training sessions on sexual harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These undisputed facts establish, as a matter of law, that AutoZone exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment, especially when contrasted with Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), the companion case to Ellerth, in which the Supreme Court held that the employer failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment because it failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment and because the supervisors were \"completely isolated from the City's higher management.\"  Id. at 2293.  See also, Rubidoux v. Colorado Mental Health Inst., 173 F.3d 1291, 1999 WL 203145 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that in Faragher the Court emphasized \"the degree of hostility and unchecked authority as well as plaintiff's 'complete isolation' from the City's higher management which rose to an actionable level\").  Conversely, in this case not only did AutoZone distribute its sexual harassment policy to every one of its employees, it also regularly trained its managers regarding its policy.  Moreover, AutoZone's supervisors, such as Noble, were not isolated from higher management.  Rather, Noble's immediate supervisor, Hunsche, visited the store approximately every two to three weeks to discuss various issues, and during these visits Shaw could have spoken with him about any problems and he could observe first-hand any issues, including any sexual harassment.  Shaw also attended a manager's meeting with the District Manager Steve Lang and all other managers in the area in March 1995 and could have used this opportunity to inform AutoZone of the problems.  Shaw also had the opportunity to speak with Lang and a regional vice president in mid-May 1995 when they visited the Rock Falls store for the day.  Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Shaw, the policy did not succeed in this case, but the law does not require success--it only requires that an employer act reasonably to prevent sexual harassment.  See Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1036 (\"[T]he law does not even require that the employer's actions prevent harassment, but merely that its response was reasonably likely to prevent future harassment.\").  The facts of this case are more than enough to establish that, as a matter of law, AutoZone exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment.  See Scrivner, 169 F.3d at 971 (affirming grant of summary judgment to employer based on Ellerth affirmative defense, where the employer adopted an anti-harassment policy).  See also Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1035-1036 (holding that employer exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment where it adopted a policy prohibiting sexual harassment which provided multiple complaint mechanisms).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first prong of the Ellerth affirmative defense also requires AutoZone to prove that it exercised reasonable care to respond to the sexual harassment.  Shaw, however, never complained of the alleged harassment.  Because Shaw never informed AutoZone of Noble's alleged harassment and because it had no reason to know of the harassment, there was nothing for AutoZone to respond to.  Under these circumstances, AutoZone's response (to do nothing beyond its reasonable attempts to prevent sexual harassment) was reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Because AutoZone has presented undisputed evidence establishing that it acted reasonably to prevent and to respond to sexual harassment, it has satisfied the first prong of Ellerth's affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on the affirmative defense, AutoZone must also establish that Shaw \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"  Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  The undisputed facts establish that AutoZone adopted a sexual harassment policy which established multiple methods for an employee to complain of sexual harassment.  Shaw failed to take advantage of any of these mechanisms.  Shaw concedes that she never alerted anyone at AutoZone to Noble's inappropriate activities.  She did not even tell Noble to stop making the offensive comments.  She also ignored AutoZone's three attempts to determine what caused her to quit her job.  As we have often said, \" 'the law against sexual harassment is not self-enforcing' and an employer cannot be expected to correct harassment unless the employee makes a concerted effort to inform the employer that a problem exists.\"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1038 (quoting Perry, 126 F.3d at 1014).  In short, Shaw acted in precisely the manner that a victim of sexual harassment should not act in order to win recovery under the new law.  See also Scrivner, 169 F.3d at 971 (holding that plaintiff failed to reasonably avail herself of the employer's preventive and corrective sexual harassment policies when she never complained about the harasser's increasingly offensive behavior).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shaw argues in response that it was reasonable for her not to follow AutoZone's complaint mechanism because \"she didn't feel comfortable enough with anyone at AutoZone to speak with them about the offensive and repulsive sexual conduct displayed towards her by Noble.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While a victim of sexual harassment may legitimately feel uncomfortable discussing the harassment with an employer, that inevitable unpleasantness cannot excuse the employee from using the company's complaint mechanisms.  Accordingly, we conclude that an employee's subjective fears of confrontation, unpleasantness or retaliation do not alleviate the employee's duty under Ellerth to alert the employer to the allegedly hostile environment.  Shaw's failure to do so here satisfies AutoZone's burden under the second prong of the Ellerth affirmative defense.  See Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270 (a demonstration of an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer \"will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we note that while some cases which were decided pre-Ellerth might require remand, see, e.g., Rubidoux, 173 F.3d 1291, 1999 WL 203145; Burrell v. Star Nursery, Inc., 170 F.3d 951 (9th Cir.1999); Wilson v. City of Plane, 164 F.3d 900 (5th Cir.1999), this case can be decided on the present record because the undisputed facts which we rely upon above were fully developed in discovery.  Specifically, Shaw's attorney questioned AutoZone extensively about its sexual harassment policy and its training and response to sexual harassment complaints, and AutoZone questioned Shaw at length about witnesses to the harassment and about whether and to whom she had complained.  Moreover, in this case the parties had originally briefed the summary judgment motion based on the question of supervisory liability, although the district court did not apply that law, instead relying on our decision in Jansen.  Thus, while the standard for liability has changed, the record and arguments were fully developed for application of the new standard.  Therefore, remand is unnecessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Scrivner, 169 F.3d 969 (applying the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense on appeal and affirming summary judgment based on the complete record presented to the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Normally, the store manager would conduct the exit interview, but given the circumstances of her departure, Hunsche contacted her instead</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Parkins, we held that the harassers were not supervisors.  Accordingly, we applied the standard for co-worker harassment, as opposed to the supervisory liability standard.  However, the reasonableness of the employer's actions in preventing and responding to sexual harassment is relevant under both standards, the difference being who bears the burden of proof.

Tulsa Junior College, 164 F.3d 534, 541 (10th Cir.1998)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Shaw argues that AutoZone unreasonably responded to the sexual harassment because Wroy Kizer did not engage in any preventive or corrective measures in response to Noble's comment to him that Shaw was part of his harem.  According to Shaw, Noble made this comment when \"[t]he other managers were saying things that he had two females on his staff which in AutoZone is unusual and that they were saying stuff about that, so he retorted by saying, 'Yeah, I've got a harem,' or something in that regard.\"  Even assuming that Noble made this comment--something both Kizer and Noble dispute--this stray remark was too innocuous to cause a reasonable person to believe that Noble was sexually harassing Shaw such that some sort of corporate response was necessary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Shaw also seems to argue that it was reasonable for her not to have used the complaint mechanism because she had never seen AutoZone's sexual harassment policy.

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiffany Shaw was an assistant manager of AutoZone's Rock Falls, Illinois, store from February to June of 1995.  AutoZone is an automotive parts retailer with many stores nationwide.  The store manager in Rock Falls was Donald Noble.  Noble's supervisor was Area Advisor Dave Hunsche; Hunsche's supervisor was District Manager Steve Lang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shaw submitted an employment application to Noble at the Rock Falls store.  Noble sent the application to Steve Dauw, a recruiter who then reviewed the application along with other people in AutoZone's management.

In addition to adopting this sexual harassment policy and distributing it to its employees, AutoZone periodically provides training sessions for its managers concerning its sexual harassment policies and AutoZone's guidelines.  Don Noble testified in his deposition that over the course of his employment with AutoZone, he attended approximately twenty management meetings which included training or conversations on AutoZone's sexual harassment policies and procedures and the handling of sexual harassment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Shaw, Noble began making comments about her physical attributes within her first week of employment with AutoZone.  In mid-May 1995, Shaw claims the comments became more explicit with Noble asking her questions about her sex life, including inquiries about whether Shaw masturbated.  Noble discussed pornographic movies and suggested ways for her to have better sex with her husband.  Shaw also testified that Noble had told her that he had told Wroy Kizer, another store manager, that Shaw and another female employee were part of his \"harem.\"  Shaw stated that Noble continued to make sexual comments until she quit on June 6, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her deposition, Shaw testified that she quit for \"[a] lot of different reasons,\" \"my uncomfortableness about being around Don,\" as well as \"the lack of support from Don as a manager, letting the employees take advantage of me or not support[ing] me.\"  Shaw also stated in her deposition that she quit because she was scheduled to have the day off on Thursday and \"they were going to make me give up my Thursday off and Don would not close the store....\" She quit by throwing her keys at Noble and telling him with profanity what he could do with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While working at AutoZone, Shaw did not report Noble's conduct to anyone nor did she tell Noble to stop making the offensive comments.  After Shaw quit, Hunsche, the Area Advisor, attempted to contact Shaw three times to conduct an exit interview, but Shaw did not return his phone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Instead, after exhausting her administrative remedies, Shaw filed suit alleging sexual harassment claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. sec.sec.2000e to 2000e-15, against both AutoZone and Noble.  Shaw also alleged a claim against Noble for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  The parties stipulated to the dismissal of the two claims against Noble individually, leaving only the claim of sexual harassment against AutoZone.  AutoZone moved for summary judgment on that claim.  On September 19, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment to AutoZone on the basis of our decision in Jansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745362\"><a href=\"/opinion/745362/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1138-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44940-alice/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 493 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc), which held that in a case of hostile work environment sexual harassment by a supervisor, the standard for the employer's liability is negligence.  The district court found that AutoZone was not negligent because it promulgated a sexual harassment policy and because Shaw had failed to notify anyone at AutoZone of Noble's conduct.  Shaw filed a timely notice of appeal, but this court stayed briefing pending the Supreme Court's decision in Ellerth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences from the facts in favor of the nonmovant.  See Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Illinois, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760217\"><a href=\"/opinion/760217/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1329-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45699-lesley-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1032 (7th Cir.1998).  Summary judgment is appropriate only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"We may affirm on any ground for which there is support in the record.\"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1032.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ellerth, the Supreme Court held that employers are strictly liable for a supervisor's sexual harassment of a subordinate, but that employers may avoid that liability by proving an affirmative defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.  When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed.  Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c).  The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.  While proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedures is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense.  And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing any unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Noble is a \"supervisor\" as that term is used in Ellerth, because AutoZone presented evidence that Noble lacked the authority to hire, fire or promote employees.  See Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1034 (\"[T]he essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim's employment.  This authority primarily consists of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline an employee.  Absent an entrustment of at least some of this authority, an employee does not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of imputing liability to the employer.\").  However, we need not decide that issue because, for purposes of summary judgment, AutoZone does not contest Noble's status as a \"supervisor.\"  Instead, AutoZone asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment based on the Ellerth affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Shaw did not suffer any tangible employment action, AutoZone may assert the Ellerth affirmative defense.  To avoid liability AutoZone must first prove that it exercised \"reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior....\" Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  While not required as a matter of law, id., the existence of an appropriate anti-harassment policy will often satisfy this first prong, see Scrivner v. Socorro Indep.  Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762207\"><a href=\"/opinion/762207/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-429-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45810-kelly-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 971 (5th Cir.1999), because \" 'Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of anti-harassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms.' \"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1037 (quoting Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, AutoZone adopted an antiharassment policy which it distributed to each of its employees.  While Shaw testified in her deposition that she had never seen AutoZone's sexual harassment policy, that is irrelevant because it is undisputed that she received a copy of the policy and that she was required as a condition of her employment to read and comply with both the policy and the other terms contained in the Employee Handbook.  She even signed an acknowledgment form stating \"I understand it is my responsibility to read and learn the policies and procedures contained in the AutoZone Handbook and Safety Booklet.\"  Under these circumstances, even if Shaw did not have actual knowledge of the policy, she had constructive knowledge of the anti-harassment policy.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span> (1998), the companion case to Ellerth, in which the Supreme Court held that the employer failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment because it failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment and because the supervisors were \"completely isolated from the City's higher management.\"  Id. at 2293.  See also, Rubidoux v. Colorado Mental Health Inst., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157815\"><a href=\"/opinion/157815/rubidoux-v-colorado-mental/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">203145</span></span> (10th Cir.1999) (noting that in Faragher the Court emphasized \"the degree of hostility and unchecked authority as well as plaintiff's 'complete isolation' from the City's higher management which rose to an actionable level\").  Conversely, in this case not only did AutoZone distribute its sexual harassment policy to every one of its employees, it also regularly trained its managers regarding its policy.  Moreover, AutoZone's supervisors, such as Noble, were not isolated from higher management.  Rather, Noble's immediate supervisor, Hunsche, visited the store approximately every two to three weeks to discuss various issues, and during these visits Shaw could have spoken with him about any problems and he could observe first-hand any issues, including any sexual harassment.  Shaw also attended a manager's meeting with the District Manager Steve Lang and all other managers in the area in March 1995 and could have used this opportunity to inform AutoZone of the problems.  Shaw also had the opportunity to speak with Lang and a regional vice president in mid-May 1995 when they visited the Rock Falls store for the day.  Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Shaw, the policy did not succeed in this case, but the law does not require success--it only requires that an employer act reasonably to prevent sexual harassment.  See Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1036 (\"[T]he law does not even require that the employer's actions prevent harassment, but merely that its response was reasonably likely to prevent future harassment.\").  The facts of this case are more than enough to establish that, as a matter of law, AutoZone exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment.  See Scrivner, 169 F.3d at 971 (affirming grant of summary judgment to employer based on Ellerth affirmative defense, where the employer adopted an anti-harassment policy).  See also Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1035-1036 (holding that employer exercised reasonable care to prevent sexual harassment where it adopted a policy prohibiting sexual harassment which provided multiple complaint mechanisms).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first prong of the Ellerth affirmative defense also requires AutoZone to prove that it exercised reasonable care to respond to the sexual harassment.  Shaw, however, never complained of the alleged harassment.  Because Shaw never informed AutoZone of Noble's alleged harassment and because it had no reason to know of the harassment, there was nothing for AutoZone to respond to.  Under these circumstances, AutoZone's response (to do nothing beyond its reasonable attempts to prevent sexual harassment) was reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Because AutoZone has presented undisputed evidence establishing that it acted reasonably to prevent and to respond to sexual harassment, it has satisfied the first prong of Ellerth's affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on the affirmative defense, AutoZone must also establish that Shaw \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"  Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  The undisputed facts establish that AutoZone adopted a sexual harassment policy which established multiple methods for an employee to complain of sexual harassment.  Shaw failed to take advantage of any of these mechanisms.  Shaw concedes that she never alerted anyone at AutoZone to Noble's inappropriate activities.  She did not even tell Noble to stop making the offensive comments.  She also ignored AutoZone's three attempts to determine what caused her to quit her job.  As we have often said, \" 'the law against sexual harassment is not self-enforcing' and an employer cannot be expected to correct harassment unless the employee makes a concerted effort to inform the employer that a problem exists.\"  Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1038 (quoting Perry, 126 F.3d at 1014).  In short, Shaw acted in precisely the manner that a victim of sexual harassment should not act in order to win recovery under the new law.  See also Scrivner, 169 F.3d at 971 (holding that plaintiff failed to reasonably avail herself of the employer's preventive and corrective sexual harassment policies when she never complained about the harasser's increasingly offensive behavior).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shaw argues in response that it was reasonable for her not to follow AutoZone's complaint mechanism because \"she didn't feel comfortable enough with anyone at AutoZone to speak with them about the offensive and repulsive sexual conduct displayed towards her by Noble.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While a victim of sexual harassment may legitimately feel uncomfortable discussing the harassment with an employer, that inevitable unpleasantness cannot excuse the employee from using the company's complaint mechanisms.  Accordingly, we conclude that an employee's subjective fears of confrontation, unpleasantness or retaliation do not alleviate the employee's duty under Ellerth to alert the employer to the allegedly hostile environment.  Shaw's failure to do so here satisfies AutoZone's burden under the second prong of the Ellerth affirmative defense.  See Ellerth, 118 S.Ct. at 2270 (a demonstration of an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer \"will normally suffice to satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the defense\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we note that while some cases which were decided pre-Ellerth might require remand, see, e.g., Rubidoux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157815\"><a href=\"/opinion/157815/rubidoux-v-colorado-mental/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">203145</span></span>; Burrell v.

Specifically, Shaw's attorney questioned AutoZone extensively about its sexual harassment policy and its training and response to sexual harassment complaints, and AutoZone questioned Shaw at length about witnesses to the harassment and about whether and to whom she had complained.  Moreover, in this case the parties had originally briefed the summary judgment motion based on the question of supervisory liability, although the district court did not apply that law, instead relying on our decision in Jansen.  Thus, while the standard for liability has changed, the record and arguments were fully developed for application of the new standard.  Therefore, remand is unnecessary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Scrivner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762207\"><a href=\"/opinion/762207/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-429-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45810-kelly-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span> (applying the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense on appeal and affirming summary judgment based on the complete record presented to the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Normally, the store manager would conduct the exit interview, but given the circumstances of her departure, Hunsche contacted her instead</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Parkins, we held that the harassers were not supervisors.

Nancy Torresen, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Howard, Ripple,* and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joshua Bachrach, with whom Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman\n& Dicker LLP, Byrne Joseph Decker, and Pierce Atwood LLP were on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Gisele M. Nadeau for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            March 29, 2013\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           RIPPLE, Circuit Judge. David Hannington filed this ERISA\n\naction against Sun Life and Health Insurance Company (“Sun”) after\n\nSun reduced his disability payments under an ERISA-qualified plan\n\n(the “Plan”) because he also was receiving disability compensation\n\nunder the Veterans’ Benefits Act.      The parties filed cross-motions\n\nfor judgment on the record.   After a hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that the district court grant Mr. Hannington’s motion\n\nand deny Sun’s. The district court approved the magistrate judge’s\n\nrecommended decision and entered judgment for Mr. Hannington.1    Sun\n\ntimely appealed.2   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n                                  A.\n\n           Mr. Hannington participated, through his employer, in a\n\ngroup long-term disability plan issued by Sun, then known as GE\n\nGroup Life Assurance Company (“GE”).       Under the Plan, a disabled\n\nbeneficiary receives sixty percent of his pre-disability salary.\n\nHowever, the Plan reduces this benefit by amounts received as\n\n\n\n     1\n        The district court’s jurisdiction was predicated on 28\nU.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e).\n     2\n          The jurisdiction of this court is based on 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f“Other Income.” This term is defined in the “Other Income” section\n\nof the Plan, which lists seven categories of income that will be\n\ndeemed “Other Income” for purposes of reducing payments under the\n\nPlan.     The fifth of these categories, the focus of the current\n\ndispute,    defines     “Other    Income”   to   include    “any   amount   of\n\ndisability or retirement benefits under:             a) the United States\n\nSocial Security Act . . . ; b) the Railroad Retirement Act; c) any\n\nother similar act or law provided in any jurisdiction.”3             The Plan\n\nfurther identifies GE, now replaced by Sun, as the claims fiduciary\n\nand grants it “the sole and exclusive discretion and power to . . .\n\nconstrue any and all issues relating to eligibility for benefits.”4\n\nIt   further    provides   that    “[a]ll   findings,      decisions,   and/or\n\ndeterminations of any type made by the Claims Fiduciary shall not\n\nbe disturbed unless the Claims Fiduciary has acted in an arbitrary\n\nand/or capricious manner.”5\n\n            Mr. Hannington cannot work because he suffers from a\n\n\n\n      3\n        A.R. 103. These seven categories of “Other Income” are:\n(1)   temporary   or   permanent   awards  under   various   laws;\n(2) disability benefits under any compulsory benefit act or law;\n(3) disability or loss of income benefits under various insurance\nplans; (4) benefits received under an employer retirement plan;\n(5) the disputed section; (6) income received from any salary\ncontinuance plan; and (7) benefits under unemployment compensation\nlaws.   Id.   To provide context, a copy of the “Other Income”\nsection, denominated “Part 5” of the Plan, is appended to this\nopinion.\n      4\n          Id. at 120.\n      5\n          Id.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fblood disease that he contracted from the administration of\n\nvaccinations during his service in the United States Air Force. On\n\naccount    of     this     disability,          he   receives       service-connected\n\ndisability       compensation      (“VA      benefits”)      under    the     Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act.\n\n            Sun approved Mr. Hannington’s claim for benefits under\n\nthe Plan.        Upon learning that Mr. Hannington was receiving VA\n\nbenefits, however, Sun determined that these VA benefits qualify as\n\n“Other Income” and so reduced the amount of Mr. Hannington’s\n\nmonthly    plan     benefit     by    the    amount     of    his    VA     benefits.\n\nConsequently, Mr. Hannington filed an administrative appeal as\n\nrequired by the Plan.         Sun denied the appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            B.\n\n            Mr. Hannington then initiated this action in the district\n\ncourt.     When     Sun    submitted      the     administrative      record    to   the\n\ndistrict court, it also produced an affidavit from the associate\n\ndirector    of    its     appeal     unit    that    set     forth    the   procedures\n\nimplemented by Sun to fulfill its fiduciary duties under the Plan.\n\nIt submitted that these procedures sufficiently neutralize its\n\nstructural conflict of interest as both plan underwriter and\n\nfiduciary.\n\n            The district court referred the case to a magistrate\n\njudge for a recommended decision.                    In her recommendation, the\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fmagistrate judge first noted that, because the plan document gave\n\nSun discretion to interpret and construe the Plan’s language, the\n\ncourt’s review was governed by the deferential arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard.        The magistrate judge further noted, however,\n\nthat the fact that Sun was construing policy language in favor of\n\nits own financial interest while laboring under a structural\n\nconflict of interest was not an irrelevant factor and that the\n\ncourt was entitled to take such a situation into consideration.\n\n            Turning to the merits of the dispute, the magistrate\n\njudge reviewed the similarities that Sun had pointed out between\n\nthe   Social   Security     Act   and   the    Veterans’     Benefits   Act6   and\n\ncompared    the    service-connected          disability     compensation      that\n\nMr. Hannington receives to Social Security disability benefits.\n\nShe reviewed the respective statutes’ definitions of “disability”\n\nand their purposes in awarding disability benefits.7                Ultimately,\n\nthe   magistrate    judge    determined       that   those   similarities      were\n\n\n      6\n         Before the magistrate judge, Sun provided no specific\ndiscussion of the Railroad Retirement Act. R.31 at 9 n.8. Sun\nidentified the following similarities between the Veterans’\nBenefits Act and the Social Security Act: (1) they are federal\nlaws, which provide disability benefits; (2) benefits are paid\nperiodically; (3) death benefits are available; (4) the Acts\ncontain   anti-assignment   clauses;   (5)   benefit   claims   are\nadministered by independent agencies; and (6) a single application\ncan be used to apply for both Social Security and VA benefits.\nR.21 at 6. Sun also argued that benefits under both are awarded\nwithout regard to fault and represent compensation for lost earning\ncapacity.   Id.    The magistrate judge rejected these last two\narguments as erroneous. R.31 at 9-10 nn. 9, 10.\n      7\n          R.31 at 9-11.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsuperficial and represented only a “few common threads [which] are\n\nwoven into larger and distinctly different fabrics.”8             In her view,\n\nit was “the differences [between these Acts] that stand out upon\n\ncomparison, not the similarities.”9\n\n            She   also    emphasized     Sun’s    structural      conflict   of\n\ninterest, concluding that “[a] fiduciary free of a structural\n\nconflict of interest would not attempt to emphasize the limited\n\nsimilarities given the more substantial and meaningful differences\n\nthat are readily apparent, particularly as the Plan Certificate\n\nmakes no mention of VA benefits at all.”10                In the magistrate\n\njudge’s view, “[a] reasonable fiduciary would be troubled by the\n\n[Plan’s]    omission     of   any   reference    to   veterans’   benefits   or\n\nservice-connected disability compensation.”11 The magistrate judge\n\nfound persuasive the decision of the Eighth Circuit in Riley v. Sun\n\nLife & Health Insurance Co., 657 F.3d 739, 741 (8th Cir. 2011),\n\ncert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1870 (2012), in which the court construed\n\nidentical plan language under a de novo standard of review because\n\nthe fiduciary’s interpretation was “based on its construction of\n\nexisting law.” The Riley court concluded that VA benefits, awarded\n\n“for a wartime service-related disability, as a matter of statutory\n\n\n     8\n          Id. at 10.\n     9\n          Id.\n     10\n           Id.\n     11\n           Id. at 11.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fconstruction, do not derive from an act that is ‘similar to’ the\n\nSSA [Social Security Act] or the RRA [Railroad Retirement Act].”\n\nId. at 742.\n\n           In due course, the district court concurred in the\n\nmagistrate       judge’s   analysis        and   entered   judgment    for\n\nMr. Hannington.     Sun then filed this timely appeal.\n\n\n\n                                      II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n           We review de novo the district court’s grant of judgment\n\non the record. Morales-Alejandro v. Med. Card Sys., Inc., 486 F.3d\n\n693, 698 (1st Cir. 2007).       Therefore, we must employ the same\n\nstandard of review that the district court was required to employ\n\non the issue for decision.\n\n\n\n                                      A.\n\n           The     district   court        reviewed   Sun’s   offset    of\n\nMr. Hannington’s VA benefits under a deferential, arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard.12     This deferential standard is appropriate\n\nwhen “the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary[13]\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\n\n\n     12\n          See id. at 5.\n     13\n        “Administrator,” “claims fiduciary” and “plan fiduciary”\nare used interchangeably by the parties in this case.         For\nconsistency, we shall refer to Sun as the Plan’s “fiduciary.”\n\n                                  -7-\n\fconstrue the terms of the plan.”             Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n\nBruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989).              Thus, when such discretion is\n\nvested in the plan fiduciary, as it is here, our standard of review\n\nfor the fiduciary’s interpretation of plan language is deferential.\n\nSee Cusson v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 592 F.3d 215, 230 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).      However, when the plan fiduciary is required, in the\n\ncourse   of    determining    the     meaning       of   the   plan   language,   to\n\ninterpret material outside the plan, our review of the extra-plan\n\nmaterial is de novo.\n\n              For instance, in Coffin v. Bowater Inc., 501 F.3d 80 (1st\n\nCir. 2007), we addressed an administrator’s determination that its\n\nplan obligations to its subsidiary’s workers terminated upon the\n\nsubsidiary’s sale. The plan at issue allowed the administrator “to\n\nmodify, amend or terminate the plan at any time” and “afford[ed]\n\nthe administrator substantial deference.”                    Id. at 84, 85.       The\n\nCoffin   administrator       argued    that     a    stock     purchase    agreement\n\nexecuted in connection with the sale contained language sufficient\n\nto   terminate    its   obligations      and    satisfy        ERISA’s    procedural\n\ntermination requirements.        Id. at 84.          Discussing the standard of\n\nreview, we held that “[w]here the administrator’s determination of\n\neligibility depends upon an interpretation of non-plan documents\n\n(in this case, the [stock purchase agreement]), our review is . . .\n\nde novo.”     Id. at 85 (citing Firestone, 489 U.S. at 112).                Thus, we\n\nreviewed de novo the administrator’s interpretation of the stock\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fpurchase agreement and of ERISA (that the stock purchase agreement\n\nsatisfied ERISA’s requirements).\n\n               Our decision in Coffin is in accord with the decisions of\n\nthe other circuits that have recognized that when a fiduciary’s\n\ninterpretation of the plan is based on a legal determination,\n\nreview is de novo.         See, e.g., Daft v. Advest, Inc., 658 F.3d 583,\n\n594 (6th Cir. 2011) (noting that the deferential standard of review\n\n“does    not    apply    to     a    plan    administrator’s     determination   of\n\nquestions of law, such as whether a plan meets the statutory\n\ndefinition of a top-hat plan; a court reviews those questions de\n\nnovo”); Riley, 657 F.3d at 741-42 (concluding in a case identical\n\nto the one before us in all significant respects that the de novo\n\nstandard of review ought to apply because the court was required to\n\nreview    the     administrator’s           “interpretation     of   a   controlling\n\nprinciple of law”--the character and scope of benefits under the\n\nVeterans’       Benefits       Act   (internal      quotation    marks   omitted));\n\nJohannssen v. Dist. No. 1--Pac. Coast Dist., MEBA Pens. Plan, 292\n\nF.3d    159,     169    (4th     Cir.   2002)      (“Such   legal    questions   are\n\nappropriate terrain for the courts, not plan administrators, and\n\nwhen eligibility determinations turn on questions of law we have\n\nnot hesitated to apply a de novo standard of review.”), abrogated\n\non other grounds by Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.S. 105\n\n(2008); Weil v. Ret. Plan Admin. Comm. of Terson Co., 913 F.2d\n\n1045, 1049 (2d Cir. 1990) (same), vacated on other grounds, 933\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fF.2d 106 (2d Cir. 1991); see also 2 Lee T. Polk, ERISA Practice &\n\nLitigation § 11:53 (2010).\n\n            In the particular dispute before us, Sun’s interpretation\n\nof the “Other Income” section of the Plan depends wholly upon its\n\ninterpretation of external, non-plan material:        the Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act,14 the Social Security Act15 and the Railroad Retirement\n\nAct.16    Under the Plan language, the character of, and especially\n\n\n     14\n         The only citation Sun provides to the Veterans’ Benefits\nAct is 38 U.S.C. § 1110. See Appellant’s Br. 16. Section 1110 is\nonly    the    provision   concerning     basic   entitlement    to\nservice-connected disability compensation. Like other courts to\nconsider the issue, see, e.g., Riley v. Sun Life & Health Ins. Co.,\n657 F.3d 739, 740 (8th Cir. 2011), we believe that the Veterans’\nBenefits Act begins at 38 U.S.C. § 101 and encompasses all of Title\n38 (Veterans’ Benefits).\n     It is probably a misnomer to refer to Title 38 this way. See\nGov’t’s Amicus Br. 5. Title 38 provides for all veterans’ benefits\nbut is not comprised of one act. In 1958, Congress passed Public\nLaw 85-857, which was codified as Title 38, “[t]o consolidate into\none Act all of the laws administered by the Veterans’\nAdministration.” Pub. L. No. 85-857, 72 Stat. 1105 (1958). This\nenactment codified provisions for both service-connected disability\ncompensation and non-service-connected disability pensions.      In\nsubsequent years, Title 38 has been amended multiple times.\nHowever, since the parties use the term “Veterans’ Benefits Act,”\nwe also refer to Title 38 in this way for ease of discussion.\n     On October 15, 2012, this court issued an order inviting the\nUnited States to file a brief as amicus curiae “presenting its view\non whether the Veterans’ Benefits Act reasonably could be\ncharacterized as similar to the Social Security Act or the Railroad\nRetirement Act such that benefits under the Veterans’ Benefits Act\ncould be deemed equivalent to those provided under the other two\nacts.” Hannington v. Sun Life & Health Ins. Co., No. 12-1085, R.32\nat 2 (Oct. 15, 2012). The court expresses its thanks to the United\nStates for having accepted the invitation and for having provided\na very helpful brief.\n     15\n          42 U.S.C. §§ 401 et seq.\n     16\n          45 U.S.C. §§ 231 et seq.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe benefits available under, the comparator acts and the statute\n\nproviding the benefits potentially available for off-set determine\n\nthe scope of benefits available under the Plan.             If the Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act is not similar to the Social Security Act and/or the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act, then Sun cannot offset Mr. Hannington’s VA\n\nbenefits.       Therefore,     because         Sun’s   decision   to    offset\n\nMr.   Hannington’s    VA   benefits      was    governed   entirely    by   its\n\ninterpretation of several statutes, the district court ought to\n\nhave reviewed de novo Sun’s determination that Mr. Hannington’s VA\n\nbenefits were “Other Income” under the Plan; this is the standard\n\nof review which we also must employ.\n\n\n\n                                      B.\n\n            We now turn to an examination of Sun’s decision, as plan\n\nfiduciary, to set off Mr. Hannington’s VA benefits against the\n\namount owed him under the Plan.\n\n\n\n                                      1.\n\n            Sun seeks reversal of the district court’s decision\n\nprohibiting   its    offset   of   Mr.     Hannington’s    service-connected\n\ndisability compensation under the Veterans’ Benefits Act against\n\nthe long-term disability payments that it provides to him under the\n\nPlan.   Sun bases its position on an interpretation of the Plan’s\n\n“Other Income” section.       In its view, under the fifth clause of\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthis section, Mr. Hannington’s VA service-connected disability\n\ncompensation must be considered income from “a similar act or law.”\n\nThe fifth clause defines “Other Income” as follows:\n\n            [a]ny amount of    disability     or   retirement\n            benefits under:\n\n            a) the United States Social Security Act to\n            which[:]\n\n                 i) you are entitled; and\n\n                 ii) your Dependents may be entitled\n                 because of your disability or retirement;\n\n            b) the Railroad Retirement Act;\n\n            c) any other similar act or law provided in\n            any jurisdiction.[17]\n\n            Sun determined that the Veterans’ Benefits Act is similar\n\nto the Social Security Act and/or the Railroad Retirement Act based\n\nsimply on its identification of some common characteristics of the\n\nstatutes.    Sun observes that all (1) are federal, (2) pay certain\n\nperiodic disability benefits, (3) have anti-assignment clauses and\n\n(4) are administered by independent agencies. It also stresses the\n\nsimilarities between the Social Security Act and the Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act:    Both pay benefits based on impairment of earning\n\ncapacity, both ensure a minimum level of income and both can have\n\nidentical qualifications because one way to qualify for VA benefits\n\nis to have been determined permanently disabled under the Social\n\nSecurity Act.\n\n\n     17\n          A.R. 103.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f             Importantly, Sun has never considered whether the VA\n\nservice-connected disability compensation Mr. Hannington receives\n\nis similar to available disability benefits under the comparator\n\nacts.     Sun’s statutory interpretation ignored the context and the\n\npurpose of the comparison.        When, as here, the object of the\n\ninquiry is to identify sources of income for purposes of set-off,\n\na meaningful comparison of the Social Security Act and the Railroad\n\nRetirement Act to a potentially similar act or law requires a\n\ncomparison of the benefits offered by the laws in question.               The\n\n“Other Income” section has no interest in the administrative\n\nmechanics    of   various   statutory    schemes    or   of   the   statutory\n\nstructure of the agency administering the disbursement.             Its focus\n\nis simply the nature of the payments and the role that they play in\n\nthe financial health of the recipient.             The district court was\n\ntherefore correct in characterizing Sun’s focus on factors not\n\nrelevant to this inquiry as “superficial.”18         Sun’s approach to the\n\n\n\n\n     18\n         R.31 at 10.   Sun also cites the Texas Supreme Court’s\nstatement in Barnett v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., 723 S.W.2d 663,\n666 (Tex. 1987), of the “similar features” of the Social Security\nAct and the Veterans’ Benefits Act. Both “are (1) governmental or\nlegislative plans providing for (2) periodic payment (3) to\nqualified individuals (4) who have suffered a physical disability\n(5) without regard to fault.     In addition, all provide death\nbenefits, have anti-assignment clauses, and are administered by\nindependent agencies.” Id. These similarities are superficial; as\nthe Texas Supreme Court went on to note, “the similarity of\nfeatures of the acts are not the key ingredient, rather it is the\nobjectives for which they were created and the manner in which the\nacts are implemented.” Id. at 666-67.\n\n                                  -13-\n\finterpretation question was thus improper and, as we shall explain,\n\nits conclusion also was erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n            Sun’s inexplicable decision to omit from its comparison\n\nof the disability statutes any examination and comparison of the\n\nsubstantive features of the veterans’ disability scheme caused it\n\nto misapprehend, seriously, the degree of dissimilarity between the\n\nVeterans’    Benefits   Act   and   the    comparator   acts.     When   the\n\nsubstantive features of the Veterans’ Benefits Act are viewed as a\n\nwhole, its    dissimilarity    in   scope   and   purpose   to   the   Social\n\nSecurity Act and the Railroad Retirement Act is evident.\n\n            The primary purpose of the Veterans’ Benefits Act is to\n\ncare for and to support those who have served our Country in the\n\nArmed Forces of the United States.19         Its purpose is to, “in the\n\nwords of Abraham Lincoln, ‘provide[] for him who has borne the\n\n\n     19\n           Title 38 therefore includes not only disability\ncompensation, but a host of other benefits for veterans. See,\ne.g., 38 U.S.C. §§        1902 (life insurance policies), 3461\n(entitlement to educational assistance), 3710 (loans to purchase or\nconstruct a primary residence). Therefore, as a threshold matter,\nthe Veterans’ Benefits Act’s broad scope demonstrates the\ninaccuracy of Sun’s view that its “primary purpose [is] providing\nthe same types of benefits” as the Social Security Act and the\nRailroad Retirement Act. Appellant’s Br. 16. The Social Security\nAct and Railroad Retirement Act do not provide life insurance, home\nor small business loans, educational benefits or any other benefits\nbeyond those for disability and retirement; they certainly do not\noffer benefits specifically designed to assist beneficiaries with\nnavigating most major facets of civilian life.       See 38 U.S.C.\n§§ 3001-4335 (Part III. Readjustment and Related Benefits).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fbattle, and his widow and his orphan.’”       Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of\n\nRadiation   Survivors, 473   U.S.   305,    309   (1985).   VA   benefits\n\ntherefore are linked not to employment but to past service in the\n\nArmed Forces.   Notably, because of this fundamental difference in\n\npurpose and scope, “funding for SSA [Social Security Act] and RRA\n\n[Railroad Retirement Act] disability benefits derives from a tax on\n\nboth the employee and employer” whereas Veterans’ Benefits Act\n\n“benefits are funded by Congress through the VA’s budget instead of\n\nby a tax on members of the military.” Riley, 657 F.3d at 742, 743.\n\n            This purpose stands in stark contrast to the Social\n\nSecurity Act and the Railroad Retirement Act.        The Social Security\n\nAct and the Railroad Retirement Act, like many of the other types\n\nof “Other Income” defined in the Plan, are insurance programs tied\n\nto the beneficiary’s employment.20         See generally Hisquierdo v.\n\nHisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 573 (1979) (discussing the Railroad\n\nRetirement Act’s purpose as “provid[ing] a system of retirement and\n\ndisability benefits for persons who pursue careers in the railroad\n\nindustry”); California Dep’t of Human Res. Dev. v. Java, 402 U.S.\n\n121, 130-32 (1971) (discussing the purposes and history of the\n\nSocial Security Act).\n\n\n\n\n     20\n        “Other Income” includes: workers’ compensation; benefits\nunder an occupational disease law; a settlement with an employer in\nlieu of workers’ compensation; benefits received under a plan\nrelated to or from the beneficiary’s employer; unemployment\ncompensation; and a salary continuance plan. A.R. 103.\n\n                                -15-\n\f            Furthermore, when we focus only on benefits related to\n\ndisability, the statutory scheme of the Veterans’ Benefits Act\n\nprovides for two different types of benefits:         service-connected\n\ndisability    compensation    (which    Mr.   Hannington   receives)   and\n\ndisability pensions for veterans of wartime service or their\n\nsurviving spouses or children.21       The latter benefit arguably might\n\nbear some substantive similarity to the benefits obtainable under\n\nthe Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act, but we\n\nneed not and do not decide that question today.              The former,\n\nhowever--the service-connected disability compensation received by\n\nMr. Hannington--is decidedly different, and it is the substantive\n\nnature of this benefit that must be compared to those under the\n\ncomparator statutes.    These VA benefits are based on diseases and\n\ninjuries incurred by service personnel on account of their military\n\nservice.    They are calculated not on a particular veteran’s actual\n\ndisability but rather “represent as far as can practicably be\n\ndetermined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting\n\nfrom such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in\n\ncivil occupations.”22        Because they     are based on the special\n\nsacrifice of illness or injury in military service, they are\n\npayable in increments of disability ranging from ten percent to one\n\n\n\n\n     21\n           See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1521, 1541, 1542.\n     22\n           38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also 38 U.S.C. § 1155.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fhundred    percent.23         Notably,    although         Congress     has    forbidden\n\nduplication for some government benefits, it has not done so when\n\nthere is     an    overlap between        Social Security         Act     or    Railroad\n\nRetirement Act benefits and VA benefits.24\n\n            There are very important substantive differences between\n\nthe Veterans’ Benefits Act and the Social Security Act and the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act, especially between the service-connected\n\ndisability    compensation        received       by    Mr.     Hannington       and   the\n\navailable benefits under the comparator acts.                     These differences\n\nrender the        Veterans’    Benefits    Act,       as   a   matter    of    statutory\n\nconstruction,       dissimilar    to     the    Social      Security     Act    and   the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act.           Thus, the VA benefits Mr. Hannington\n\nreceives are not “Other Income” for purposes of reducing the\n\npayment Sun owes Mr. Hannington under the Plan.\n\n\n\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n     23\n          See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1115.\n     24\n        See 20 C.F.R. § 226.72(d) (Railroad Retirement benefits are\nnot reduced by the receipt of VA benefits); id. § 404.408(b)(2)(ii)\n(Social Security benefits are not reduced by the receipt of VA\nbenefits).\n\n                                         -17-\n\fAPPENDIX\n\n\n\n\n  -18-\n\f",

David Hannington filed this ERISA\n\naction against Sun Life and Health Insurance Company (“Sun”) after\n\nSun reduced his disability payments under an ERISA-qualified plan\n\n(the “Plan”) because he also was receiving disability compensation\n\nunder the Veterans’ Benefits Act.      The parties filed cross-motions\n\nfor judgment on the record.   After a hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that the district court grant Mr. Hannington’s motion\n\nand deny Sun’s. The district court approved the magistrate judge’s\n\nrecommended decision and entered judgment for Mr. Hannington.1    Sun\n\ntimely appealed.2   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n                                  I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n                                  A.\n\n           Mr. Hannington participated, through his employer, in a\n\ngroup long-term disability plan issued by Sun, then known as GE\n\nGroup Life Assurance Company (“GE”).       Under the Plan, a disabled\n\nbeneficiary receives sixty percent of his pre-disability salary.\n\nHowever, the Plan reduces this benefit by amounts received as\n\n\n\n     1\n        The district court’s jurisdiction was predicated on 28\nU.S.C. § 1331 and 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e).\n     2\n          The jurisdiction of this court is based on 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1291.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f“Other Income.” This term is defined in the “Other Income” section\n\nof the Plan, which lists seven categories of income that will be\n\ndeemed “Other Income” for purposes of reducing payments under the\n\nPlan.     The fifth of these categories, the focus of the current\n\ndispute,    defines     “Other    Income”   to   include    “any   amount   of\n\ndisability or retirement benefits under:             a) the United States\n\nSocial Security Act . . . ; b) the Railroad Retirement Act; c) any\n\nother similar act or law provided in any jurisdiction.”3             The Plan\n\nfurther identifies GE, now replaced by Sun, as the claims fiduciary\n\nand grants it “the sole and exclusive discretion and power to . . .\n\nconstrue any and all issues relating to eligibility for benefits.”4\n\nIt   further    provides   that    “[a]ll   findings,      decisions,   and/or\n\ndeterminations of any type made by the Claims Fiduciary shall not\n\nbe disturbed unless the Claims Fiduciary has acted in an arbitrary\n\nand/or capricious manner.”5\n\n            Mr. Hannington cannot work because he suffers from a\n\n\n\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span>\n        <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. These seven categories of “Other Income” are:\n(1)   temporary   or   permanent   awards  under   various   laws;\n(2) disability benefits under any compulsory benefit act or law;\n(3) disability or loss of income benefits under various insurance\nplans; (4) benefits received under an employer retirement plan;\n(5) the disputed section; (6) income received from any salary\ncontinuance plan; and (7) benefits under unemployment compensation\nlaws.   Id.   To provide context, a copy of the “Other Income”\nsection, denominated “Part 5” of the Plan, is appended to this\nopinion.\n      4\n          Id. at 120.\n      5\n          Id.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fblood disease that he contracted from the administration of\n\nvaccinations during his service in the United States Air Force. On\n\naccount    of     this     disability,          he   receives       service-connected\n\ndisability       compensation      (“VA      benefits”)      under    the     Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act.\n\n            Sun approved Mr. Hannington’s claim for benefits under\n\nthe Plan.        Upon learning that Mr. Hannington was receiving VA\n\nbenefits, however, Sun determined that these VA benefits qualify as\n\n“Other Income” and so reduced the amount of Mr. Hannington’s\n\nmonthly    plan     benefit     by    the    amount     of    his    VA     benefits.\n\nConsequently, Mr. Hannington filed an administrative appeal as\n\nrequired by the Plan.         Sun denied the appeal.\n\n\n\n                                            B.\n\n            Mr. Hannington then initiated this action in the district\n\ncourt.     When     Sun    submitted      the     administrative      record    to   the\n\ndistrict court, it also produced an affidavit from the associate\n\ndirector    of    its     appeal     unit    that    set     forth    the   procedures\n\nimplemented by Sun to fulfill its fiduciary duties under the Plan.\n\nIt submitted that these procedures sufficiently neutralize its\n\nstructural conflict of interest as both plan underwriter and\n\nfiduciary.\n\n            The district court referred the case to a magistrate\n\njudge for a recommended decision.                    In her recommendation, the\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fmagistrate judge first noted that, because the plan document gave\n\nSun discretion to interpret and construe the Plan’s language, the\n\ncourt’s review was governed by the deferential arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard.        The magistrate judge further noted, however,\n\nthat the fact that Sun was construing policy language in favor of\n\nits own financial interest while laboring under a structural\n\nconflict of interest was not an irrelevant factor and that the\n\ncourt was entitled to take such a situation into consideration.\n\n            Turning to the merits of the dispute, the magistrate\n\njudge reviewed the similarities that Sun had pointed out between\n\nthe   Social   Security     Act   and   the    Veterans’     Benefits   Act6   and\n\ncompared    the    service-connected          disability     compensation      that\n\nMr. Hannington receives to Social Security disability benefits.\n\nShe reviewed the respective statutes’ definitions of “disability”\n\nand their purposes in awarding disability benefits.7                Ultimately,\n\nthe   magistrate    judge    determined       that   those   similarities      were\n\n\n      6\n         Before the magistrate judge, Sun provided no specific\ndiscussion of the Railroad Retirement Act. R.31 at 9 n.8. Sun\nidentified the following similarities between the Veterans’\nBenefits Act and the Social Security Act: (1) they are federal\nlaws, which provide disability benefits; (2) benefits are paid\nperiodically; (3) death benefits are available; (4) the Acts\ncontain   anti-assignment   clauses;   (5)   benefit   claims   are\nadministered by independent agencies; and (6) a single application\ncan be used to apply for both Social Security and VA benefits.\nR.21 at 6. Sun also argued that benefits under both are awarded\nwithout regard to fault and represent compensation for lost earning\ncapacity.   Id.    The magistrate judge rejected these last two\narguments as erroneous. R.31 at 9-10 nn. 9, 10.\n      7\n          R.31 at 9-11.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsuperficial and represented only a “few common threads [which] are\n\nwoven into larger and distinctly different fabrics.”8             In her view,\n\nit was “the differences [between these Acts] that stand out upon\n\ncomparison, not the similarities.”9\n\n            She   also    emphasized     Sun’s    structural      conflict   of\n\ninterest, concluding that “[a] fiduciary free of a structural\n\nconflict of interest would not attempt to emphasize the limited\n\nsimilarities given the more substantial and meaningful differences\n\nthat are readily apparent, particularly as the Plan Certificate\n\nmakes no mention of VA benefits at all.”10                In the magistrate\n\njudge’s view, “[a] reasonable fiduciary would be troubled by the\n\n[Plan’s]    omission     of   any   reference    to   veterans’   benefits   or\n\nservice-connected disability compensation.”11 The magistrate judge\n\nfound persuasive the decision of the Eighth Circuit in Riley v.

See\nGov’t’s Amicus Br. 5. Title 38 provides for all veterans’ benefits\nbut is not comprised of one act. In 1958, Congress passed Public\nLaw 85-857, which was codified as Title 38, “[t]o consolidate into\none Act all of the laws administered by the Veterans’\nAdministration.” Pub. L. No. 85-857, 72 Stat. 1105 (1958). This\nenactment codified provisions for both service-connected disability\ncompensation and non-service-connected disability pensions.      In\nsubsequent years, Title 38 has been amended multiple times.\nHowever, since the parties use the term “Veterans’ Benefits Act,”\nwe also refer to Title 38 in this way for ease of discussion.\n     On October 15, 2012, this court issued an order inviting the\nUnited States to file a brief as amicus curiae “presenting its view\non whether the Veterans’ Benefits Act reasonably could be\ncharacterized as similar to the Social Security Act or the Railroad\nRetirement Act such that benefits under the Veterans’ Benefits Act\ncould be deemed equivalent to those provided under the other two\nacts.” Hannington v. Sun Life & Health Ins. Co., No. 12-1085, R.32\nat 2 (Oct. 15, 2012). The court expresses its thanks to the United\nStates for having accepted the invitation and for having provided\na very helpful brief.\n     15\n          42 U.S.C. §§ 401 et seq.\n     16\n          45 U.S.C. §§ 231 et seq.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe benefits available under, the comparator acts and the statute\n\nproviding the benefits potentially available for off-set determine\n\nthe scope of benefits available under the Plan.             If the Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act is not similar to the Social Security Act and/or the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act, then Sun cannot offset Mr. Hannington’s VA\n\nbenefits.       Therefore,     because         Sun’s   decision   to    offset\n\nMr.   Hannington’s    VA   benefits      was    governed   entirely    by   its\n\ninterpretation of several statutes, the district court ought to\n\nhave reviewed de novo Sun’s determination that Mr. Hannington’s VA\n\nbenefits were “Other Income” under the Plan; this is the standard\n\nof review which we also must employ.\n\n\n\n                                      B.\n\n            We now turn to an examination of Sun’s decision, as plan\n\nfiduciary, to set off Mr. Hannington’s VA benefits against the\n\namount owed him under the Plan.\n\n\n\n                                      1.\n\n            Sun seeks reversal of the district court’s decision\n\nprohibiting   its    offset   of   Mr.     Hannington’s    service-connected\n\ndisability compensation under the Veterans’ Benefits Act against\n\nthe long-term disability payments that it provides to him under the\n\nPlan.   Sun bases its position on an interpretation of the Plan’s\n\n“Other Income” section.       In its view, under the fifth clause of\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthis section, Mr. Hannington’s VA service-connected disability\n\ncompensation must be considered income from “a similar act or law.”\n\nThe fifth clause defines “Other Income” as follows:\n\n            [a]ny amount of    disability     or   retirement\n            benefits under:\n\n            a) the United States Social Security Act to\n            which[:]\n\n                 i) you are entitled; and\n\n                 ii) your Dependents may be entitled\n                 because of your disability or retirement;\n\n            b) the Railroad Retirement Act;\n\n            c) any other similar act or law provided in\n            any jurisdiction.[17]\n\n            Sun determined that the Veterans’ Benefits Act is similar\n\nto the Social Security Act and/or the Railroad Retirement Act based\n\nsimply on its identification of some common characteristics of the\n\nstatutes.    Sun observes that all (1) are federal, (2) pay certain\n\nperiodic disability benefits, (3) have anti-assignment clauses and\n\n(4) are administered by independent agencies. It also stresses the\n\nsimilarities between the Social Security Act and the Veterans’\n\nBenefits Act:    Both pay benefits based on impairment of earning\n\ncapacity, both ensure a minimum level of income and both can have\n\nidentical qualifications because one way to qualify for VA benefits\n\nis to have been determined permanently disabled under the Social\n\nSecurity Act.\n\n\n     </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n          <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f             Importantly, Sun has never considered whether the VA\n\nservice-connected disability compensation Mr. Hannington receives\n\nis similar to available disability benefits under the comparator\n\nacts.     Sun’s statutory interpretation ignored the context and the\n\npurpose of the comparison.        When, as here, the object of the\n\ninquiry is to identify sources of income for purposes of set-off,\n\na meaningful comparison of the Social Security Act and the Railroad\n\nRetirement Act to a potentially similar act or law requires a\n\ncomparison of the benefits offered by the laws in question.               The\n\n“Other Income” section has no interest in the administrative\n\nmechanics    of   various   statutory    schemes    or   of   the   statutory\n\nstructure of the agency administering the disbursement.             Its focus\n\nis simply the nature of the payments and the role that they play in\n\nthe financial health of the recipient.             The district court was\n\ntherefore correct in characterizing Sun’s focus on factors not\n\nrelevant to this inquiry as “superficial.”18         Sun’s approach to the\n\n\n\n\n     18\n         R.31 at 10.

Both “are (1) governmental or\nlegislative plans providing for (2) periodic payment (3) to\nqualified individuals (4) who have suffered a physical disability\n(5) without regard to fault.     In addition, all provide death\nbenefits, have anti-assignment clauses, and are administered by\nindependent agencies.” Id. These similarities are superficial; as\nthe Texas Supreme Court went on to note, “the similarity of\nfeatures of the acts are not the key ingredient, rather it is the\nobjectives for which they were created and the manner in which the\nacts are implemented.” Id. at 666-67.\n\n                                  -13-\n\finterpretation question was thus improper and, as we shall explain,\n\nits conclusion also was erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n            Sun’s inexplicable decision to omit from its comparison\n\nof the disability statutes any examination and comparison of the\n\nsubstantive features of the veterans’ disability scheme caused it\n\nto misapprehend, seriously, the degree of dissimilarity between the\n\nVeterans’    Benefits   Act   and   the    comparator   acts.     When   the\n\nsubstantive features of the Veterans’ Benefits Act are viewed as a\n\nwhole, its    dissimilarity    in   scope   and   purpose   to   the   Social\n\nSecurity Act and the Railroad Retirement Act is evident.\n\n            The primary purpose of the Veterans’ Benefits Act is to\n\ncare for and to support those who have served our Country in the\n\nArmed Forces of the United States.19         Its purpose is to, “in the\n\nwords of Abraham Lincoln, ‘provide[] for him who has borne the\n\n\n     19\n           Title 38 therefore includes not only disability\ncompensation, but a host of other benefits for veterans. See,\ne.g., 38 U.S.C. §§        1902 (life insurance policies), 3461\n(entitlement to educational assistance), 3710 (loans to purchase or\nconstruct a primary residence). Therefore, as a threshold matter,\nthe Veterans’ Benefits Act’s broad scope demonstrates the\ninaccuracy of Sun’s view that its “primary purpose [is] providing\nthe same types of benefits” as the Social Security Act and the\nRailroad Retirement Act. Appellant’s Br. 16. The Social Security\nAct and Railroad Retirement Act do not provide life insurance, home\nor small business loans, educational benefits or any other benefits\nbeyond those for disability and retirement; they certainly do not\noffer benefits specifically designed to assist beneficiaries with\nnavigating most major facets of civilian life.

VA   benefits\n\ntherefore are linked not to employment but to past service in the\n\nArmed Forces.   Notably, because of this fundamental difference in\n\npurpose and scope, “funding for SSA [Social Security Act] and RRA\n\n[Railroad Retirement Act] disability benefits derives from a tax on\n\nboth the employee and employer” whereas Veterans’ Benefits Act\n\n“benefits are funded by Congress through the VA’s budget instead of\n\nby a tax on members of the military.” Riley, 657 F.3d at 742, 743.\n\n            This purpose stands in stark contrast to the Social\n\nSecurity Act and the Railroad Retirement Act.        The Social Security\n\nAct and the Railroad Retirement Act, like many of the other types\n\nof “Other Income” defined in the Plan, are insurance programs tied\n\nto the beneficiary’s employment.20         See generally Hisquierdo v.\n\nHisquierdo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109976\"><a href=\"/opinion/109976/hisquierdo-v-hisquierdo/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (1979) (discussing the Railroad\n\nRetirement Act’s purpose as “provid[ing] a system of retirement and\n\ndisability benefits for persons who pursue careers in the railroad\n\nindustry”); California Dep’t of Human Res.

A.R. 103.\n\n                                -15-\n\f            Furthermore, when we focus only on benefits related to\n\ndisability, the statutory scheme of the Veterans’ Benefits Act\n\nprovides for two different types of benefits:         service-connected\n\ndisability    compensation    (which    Mr.   Hannington   receives)   and\n\ndisability pensions for veterans of wartime service or their\n\nsurviving spouses or children.21       The latter benefit arguably might\n\nbear some substantive similarity to the benefits obtainable under\n\nthe Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act, but we\n\nneed not and do not decide that question today.              The former,\n\nhowever--the service-connected disability compensation received by\n\nMr. Hannington--is decidedly different, and it is the substantive\n\nnature of this benefit that must be compared to those under the\n\ncomparator statutes.    These VA benefits are based on diseases and\n\ninjuries incurred by service personnel on account of their military\n\nservice.    They are calculated not on a particular veteran’s actual\n\ndisability but rather “represent as far as can practicably be\n\ndetermined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting\n\nfrom such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in\n\ncivil occupations.”22        Because they     are based on the special\n\nsacrifice of illness or injury in military service, they are\n\npayable in increments of disability ranging from ten percent to one\n\n\n\n\n     21\n           See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1521, 1541, 1542.\n     22\n           38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also 38 U.S.C. § 1155.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fhundred    percent.23         Notably,    although         Congress     has    forbidden\n\nduplication for some government benefits, it has not done so when\n\nthere is     an    overlap between        Social Security         Act     or    Railroad\n\nRetirement Act benefits and VA benefits.24\n\n            There are very important substantive differences between\n\nthe Veterans’ Benefits Act and the Social Security Act and the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act, especially between the service-connected\n\ndisability    compensation        received       by    Mr.     Hannington       and   the\n\navailable benefits under the comparator acts.                     These differences\n\nrender the        Veterans’    Benefits    Act,       as   a   matter    of    statutory\n\nconstruction,       dissimilar    to     the    Social      Security     Act    and   the\n\nRailroad Retirement Act.

Swann's motion challenged the propriety of a district court\norder extending the period of his supervised release, and a subsequent\norder revoking his supervised release and ordering Swann incarcer-\nated for a period of one year. Swann asserts that the district court\nlacked authority to extend the term of his supervised release based on\nhis use of drugs in violation of the conditions of his supervised\nrelease. We agree that Swann's possession of a controlled substance\nduring his supervised release required revocation of his supervised\nrelease and incarceration under 18 U.S.C.A. § 3583(g) (West Supp.\n1999). See United States v. Clark, 30 F.3d 23, 24-26 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\nWe disagree, however, with Swann's position that under the pre-\n1994 version of § 3583(g), the court should have imposed a period of\nincarceration not exceeding eight months for his second violation of\nthe conditions of his supervised release, which also involved Swann's\nabuse of drugs. Because the former version of § 3583(g) did not\naddress the maximum term of incarceration for a subsection\n(g) violation, even before 1994 district courts were authorized to look\nto the maximum term allowed under 18 U.S.C.A. § 3583(e) (West\nSupp. 1999), when setting the term of incarceration for a subsection\n(g) violation of supervised release. See United States v. Davis, 53\nF.3d 638, 640 n.4 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Rockwell, 984 F.2d\n1112, 1115 (10th Cir. 1993) (citing cases). Subsection (e) authorized\nincarceration of up to two years for a Class D felon such as Swann.\nSee § 3583(e). Moreover, the pre-1994 version of § 3583(e) also per-\nmitted two additional years incarceration because that was the origi-\nnal term of Swann's supervised release. See United States v. Barrow,\n913 F. Supp. 458, 460 (E.D. Va. 1996). Hence, the district court prop-\nerly found that subsection (e) authorized the one-year term of incar-\n\n                    2\n\fceration imposed on Swann, and he was not prejudiced by the\napplication of the current version of subsection (e).\n\nAccordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and reverse and\nvacate that portion of the district court's order upholding the exten-\nsion of the term of Swann's supervised release.

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nOn January 20, 1995, Water's Edge Development, LLC (Water's\nEdge) brought this diversity action against Edward Bunn (Bunn) in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In its\ncomplaint, Water's Edge alleged that Bunn breached a contract (the\nContract) wherein Bunn agreed to sell his land to Water's Edge.1 Pur-\nsuant to Maryland law, Water's Edge sought specific performance\nand any damages created by Bunn's alleged breach. 2 Bunn, however,\nlost the land when Water's Edge purchased it at a subsequent foreclo-\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 The Contract was signed originally by Mohamed Tobah, on behalf of\nUniversal Development & Construction Company (Universal). Tobah is\nthe president of Universal. Universal, pursuant to an assignment clause\nin the Contract, assigned the Contract to Water's Edge. Water's Edge is\na limited liability corporation created by Tobah to develop the land\nobtained from Bunn. These parties will be referred to collectively as\nWater's Edge.\n2 The Contract contained a provision requiring that it be construed\nunder Maryland law.\n\n                    2\n\fsure auction on February 17, 1995. Water's Edge later successfully\nmoved to amend its complaint to replace its request for specific per-\nformance with a request for a return of its deposit monies.\n\nIn response to Water's Edge's breach of contract claim, Bunn filed\na counterclaim against Water's Edge and a third-party complaint\nagainst Universal and Tobah, purportedly alleging breach of contract,\nfraud, and a myriad of other noncontractual claims. Bunn's pleading,\nhowever, was not broken down into separate counts alleging the spe-\ncific elements of each claim but, instead, consisted of fifteen num-\nbered paragraphs setting forth the factual basis for his breach of\ncontract claim. Both parties filed cross motions for summary judg-\nment on the issue of whether either party had breached the Contract.\nWater's Edge also filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue\nof the applicability of the liquidated damages provision in the Contract.3\n\nOn September 27, 1996, the district court issued a memorandum\nopinion and order denying Bunn's motion for summary judgment and\ngranting Water's Edge's motion for summary judgment as to the liq-\nuidated damages provision.4 The memorandum opinion and order\ndetermined that if Water's Edge had breached the Contract, Bunn was\nonly entitled to receive liquidated damages in the form of the deposit\nmonies he had already received.\n\nIn response to the district court's September 27, 1996 memoran-\ndum opinion and order, Bunn filed a motion for reconsideration. Bunn\nalso filed a motion for leave to file a counterclaim and third-party\ncomplaint in response to the district court permitting Water's Edge to\namend its complaint from a request for specific performance to a\nrequest for monetary damages. In these motions, Bunn asserted that\nthe district court erred in its decision regarding the liquidated dam-\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 The liquidated damages provision provided that, in the event of a\nbreach by Water's Edge, Bunn would be entitled to keep $75,000 in\ndeposit monies. In addition, Water's Edge would be required to return to\nBunn his \"feasibility materials\"--engineering documents that Bunn\ndeveloped prior to the signing of the Contract.\n4 The district court's September 27, 1996 memorandum opinion and\norder did not address Water's Edge's claim that Bunn had breached the\nContract, nor did it address Bunn's noncontractual claims.\n\n                    3\n\fages provision and that it had failed to address his noncontractual\nclaims, including his claim for return of the feasibility materials.\n\nOn February 11, 1997, Water's Edge filed a motion for voluntary\ndismissal without prejudice, agreeing to forego its deposit monies and\na trial on whether Bunn breached the Contract. Water's Edge, how-\never, reserved the right to refile its breach of contract claim in the\nevent that Bunn was successful on appeal.\n\nOn September 29, 1997, the district court issued another memoran-\ndum opinion and order denying all of Bunn's pending motions and\ndismissing Bunn's noncontractual claims as insufficiently pled. In the\nsame memorandum opinion and order, the district court ruled on\nWater's Edge's February 11, 1997 motion for voluntary dismissal.\nAlthough the memorandum opinion and order granted Water's Edge's\nmotion to voluntarily dismiss its breach of contract claim, it required\nWater's Edge to tender to Bunn the feasibility materials. In addition,\nthe district court granted Water's Edge the option of refiling its\nbreach of contract claim if the district court rulings were reversed on\nappeal.\n\nOn October 8, 1997, Bunn filed another motion for reconsideration\nrequesting the district court to reconsider its September 29, 1997\nmemorandum opinion and order dismissing Bunn's noncontractual\nclaims. On January 2, 1998, Bunn filed an additional motion request-\ning leave to file an amended counterclaim and third-party complaint\nthat purportedly alleged specific claims of fraud, misrepresentation,\nbreach of fiduciary duty, and constructive fraud.\n\nOn September 8, 1998, the district court issued its final memoran-\ndum opinion and order denying Bunn's motions for reconsideration\nand for leave to file an amended counterclaim and third-party com-\nplaint. This memorandum opinion and order also held that Water's\nEdge had complied with the court's prior order requiring that the fea-\nsibility materials be returned to Bunn. On October 5, 1998, Bunn filed\na notice of appeal challenging the award of summary judgment to\nWater's Edge as to the liquidated damages provision of the Contract,\nthe denial of summary judgment to Bunn, and the dismissal of his\nnoncontractual claims.\n\n                    4\n\fUpon review of the briefs and the record, and after consideration\nof oral arguments, we conclude that the district court was correct in\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Water's Edge as to the liqui-\ndated damages provision of the Contract, denying summary judgment\nto Bunn, and dismissing Bunn's noncontractual claims. Accordingly,\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons stated in\nits memorandum opinions and orders. See Water's Edge Dev., LLC\nv. Bunn, Civ. A. No. DKC 95-200 (D. Md. Sept. 27, 1996); Water's\nEdge Dev., LLC v. Bunn, Civ. A. No. 95-200 (D. Md. Sept. 29, 1997);\nWater's Edge Dev., LLC v. Bunn, Civ. A. No. 95-200 (D. Md.

See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nWilliam Mitchell Frazier appeals from his conviction for passing\ncounterfeit United States currency, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 472\n(1994). On appeal he argues that his right to counsel was violated, the\ncourt erred in denying his counsel's motion to withdraw, and disputes\nnumerous evidentiary rulings. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nWe find that the court did not deny Frazier his right to counsel in\nallowing him to testify in a narrative form without direct examination\nby defense counsel. The court gave adequate safeguards and warnings\nto ensure a fair trial and that the form of testimony did not amount\nto a denial of counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution. See\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). We find that the court\ndid not abuse its discretion by denying defense counsel's motion to\nwithdraw. See United States v. Morsley, 64 F.3d 907, 918 (4th Cir.\n1995); United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, 35 F.3d 953, 956 (4th Cir.\n1994).\n\nWe find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making\nthe disputed evidentiary rulings. The felony and larceny convictions\nand alias evidence were properly admitted under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)\nand Fed. R. Evid. 609. The evidence of alleged threats Frazier made\nto Shauna Howard were also properly admitted. See United States v.\nBillups, 692 F.2d 320, 329-30 (4th Cir. 1982). Finally, we find that\nthe court's rulings on the defense's exhibit of a U-Haul receipt were\nproper and without prejudice to Frazier.\n\nWe therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument\nbecause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the\nmaterials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional\nprocess.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                    2\n\f",

Labell, Jr., Newport News, Virginia, for Appellant. Helen F.\nFahey, United States Attorney, Kevin M. Comstock, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, Norfolk, Virginia, for Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\fUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nWilliam Mitchell Frazier appeals from his conviction for passing\ncounterfeit United States currency, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 472\n(1994). On appeal he argues that his right to counsel was violated, the\ncourt erred in denying his counsel's motion to withdraw, and disputes\nnumerous evidentiary rulings. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nWe find that the court did not deny Frazier his right to counsel in\nallowing him to testify in a narrative form without direct examination\nby defense counsel. The court gave adequate safeguards and warnings\nto ensure a fair trial and that the form of testimony did not amount\nto a denial of counsel at a critical stage of the prosecution. See\nStrickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). We find that the court\ndid not abuse its discretion by denying defense counsel's motion to\nwithdraw. See United States v. Morsley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703173\"><a href=\"/opinion/703173/united-states-v-allen-morsley-aka-amni-conoa-aka-baldhead-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918 (4th Cir.\n1995); United States v. Corporan-Cuevas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678518\"><a href=\"/opinion/678518/united-states-v-beatriz-corporan-cuevas-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956 (4th Cir.\n1994).\n\nWe find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making\nthe disputed evidentiary rulings. The felony and larceny convictions\nand alias evidence were properly admitted under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)\nand Fed. R. Evid. 609. The evidence of alleged threats Frazier made\nto Shauna Howard were also properly admitted. See United States v.\nBillups, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410393\"><a href=\"/opinion/410393/united-states-v-myles-e-billups-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329-30 (4th Cir. 1982). Finally, we find that\nthe court's rulings on the defense's exhibit of a U-Haul receipt were\nproper and without prejudice to Frazier.\n\nWe therefore affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument\nbecause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the\nmaterials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional\nprocess.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                    2\n\f</pre>",

He was tried before a jury, who sentenced the defendant to Sixty (60) Years in the penitentiary. He requested a casemade so that he might appeal his case to the Court of Criminal Appeals. Before the casemade was prepared, the court reporter who recorded the testimony died, and defendant was granted a new trial. In the case at bar, he was identified as the person who, along with a co-defendant, robbed a Humpty Dumpty Store on January 15, 1968. The co-defendant received a sentence of Ninety-Nine (99) Years in the penitentiary. Defendant was identified by four employees of the store as one of the men who was involved in the robbery. Defendant offered one witness  the co-defendant, who testified that defendant was not the person with him during the robbery. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*751</span> The jury found the defendant guilty and sentenced him to Seventy-Five (75) Years in the penitentiary. The defendant was represented at the trial by the Public Defender, and on appeal he represented himself and evidently prepared his own briefs.</p>\n<p>Defendant asserts numerous assignments of error, mostly dealing with an illegal search and seizure, and even though we agree that the search and seizure was questionable, the fruits of said search and seizure were never introduced in evidence. He further contends that the pre-trial line-up rendered the identifying witnesses testimony inadmissable as it was suggestive and persuasive. However, each witness positively identified defendant as the person involved in the robbery, independent of the line-up and no mention of the line-up was made by the state until after it had been brought out by the defendant. The trial court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the validity of the line-up and instructed the district attorney not to present any evidence regarding it. We have found no merit to defendant's contention of error.</p>\n<p>There are some inclination of courts to adopt the rationale that, in a case such as this, the court is bound by the first sentence imposed before the appeal  which in this case was 60 years; and after defendant was successful on appeal, at a new trial he was sentenced to 75 years in prison. See, United States v. Gambert, 433 F.2d 321. Also see, State of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656. The above cited cases even where defendant was successful on appeal and retrial resulted in greater punishment than that rendered on the first trial, and the Court said in substance that the greater sentence on retrial was \"unconstitutional and void\". However, this Court as it is now constituted, does not see fit to adopt such as the law, but instead modify said sentence to Sixty (60) Years in the interest of justice, and defendant to be given credit for the time served as a result of the case he won on appeal.

We have jurisdiction. <i>See</i> art. V, § 3(b)(9), Fla. Const.</p>\n<p>In the early morning hours of September 23, 1986, Reaves fatally shot Deputy Sheriff Richard Raczkoski. Our prior opinion sets forth the relevant facts and procedural history. <i>See </i><i>Reaves v. State,</i> 639 So.2d 1, 3 (Fla.1994). After the jury recommended death by a vote of ten to two, the trial court concluded that the aggravating circumstances of the crime<sup>[1]</sup> outweighed the mitigating circumstances<sup>[2]</sup> and followed the jury's recommendation. On direct appeal, appellate counsel raised sixteen claims.<sup>[3]</sup> This Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. <i>See id.</i> Reaves filed a motion for postconviction relief with the trial court, which was summarily denied. This Court remanded the matter to the trial court, finding that the trial court erred in summarily denying Reaves' claim relative to whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue a voluntary intoxication defense. <i>Reaves v. State,</i> 826 So.2d 932 (Fla.2002). Reaves now files this petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>In his first claim, Reaves asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective by (1) failing to argue the trial court's error in prohibiting the admission of Dr. Weitz's psychological testimony during the guilt phase, (2) failing to properly argue on appeal issues pertaining to Hinton's prior inconsistent statements, (3) failing to properly argue Reaves' claim regarding the admissibility of evidence relative to his attempt to sell cocaine in Georgia, and (4) improperly arguing the trial court's error when it failed to find numerous mitigating factors. These claims, or variants to the claims, have already been raised and addressed by this Court on direct appeal. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*398</span> <i>See </i><i>Reaves,</i> 639 So.2d at 3. As we have repeatedly held, \"it is improper to argue in a habeas petition a variant to a claim previously decided.\" <i>Porter v. Moore,</i> 27 Fla. L. Weekly S606, S606 (Fla. June 20, 2002). <i>See also </i><i>Jones v. Moore,</i> 794 So.2d 579, 586 (Fla.2001) (\"This Court previously has made clear that habeas is not proper to argue a variant to an already decided issue.\"); <i>Routly v. Wainwright,</i> 502 So.2d 901, 903 (Fla.1987) (\"[P]etitioner's contention that [the point] was inadequately argued merely expresses dissatisfaction with the outcome of the argument in that it did not achieve a favorable result for petitioner. We therefore decline petitioner's invitation to utilize the writ of habeas as a vehicle for the re-argument of issues which have been raised and ruled on by this Court.\") (citation and quotation marks omitted). Hence we deny relief.</p>\n<p>Reaves next contends that his appellate counsel was ineffective when he failed to raise as error the trial court's denial of his motion to disclose Officer Raczkoski's personnel recordsrecords which he contends could have shown how Officer Raczkoski tended to respond in stressful situations. The record reveals that the trial court denied Reaves' motion to compel based in part on the judge's belief that this information may be available in public records:</p>\n<blockquote>[B]efore I determine whether [the records are] in the quasi custody of the prosecution through another government agency encompassed within the Nineteenth Circuit, I want you to explore the public records requirements, and in the event that all other avenues fail, pursuant to the [public records] statute, then I'll allow you to refile.</blockquote>\n<p>Defense counsel did not pursue the matter further, so this issue was not preserved for appeal.<sup>[4]</sup> As this issue does not concern a fundamental error, \"appellate counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to raise an unpreserved claim.\" <i>Asay v. Moore,</i> 828 So.2d 985, 993 (Fla.2002). We deny this claim.</p>\n<p>Reaves' final claim asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Reaves' prior convictions should not have been considered as an aggravating factor. Other than one cursory sentence, however, counsel fails to provide any argument relative to this ground, and accordingly, we find that it is not properly before this Court. <i>See </i><i>Duest v. Dugger,</i> 555 So.2d 849, 852 (Fla.1990) (\"The purpose of an appellate brief is to present arguments in support of the points on appeal. Merely making reference to arguments below without further elucidation does not suffice to preserve issues, and these claims are deemed to have been waived.\"). Accordingly, we deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p>It is so ordered.</p>\n<p>WELLS, LEWIS, QUINCE, and CANTERO, JJ., and SHAW, Senior Justice, concur.</p>\n<p>PARIENTE, J., concurs in result only with an opinion, in which ANSTEAD, C.J., concurs.</p>\n<p>PARIENTE, J., concurring in result only.</p>\n<p>I concur in result only because, with one exception,<sup>[5]</sup> I do not believe that the issues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*399</span> in Reaves' first claim of ineffective assistance are procedurally barred. Reaves asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective in the manner in which he argued the issues of the exclusion of prior inconsistent statements by witness Hinton, the admission of evidence of his attempted cocaine sale, and the trial court's failure to find numerous mitigating factors. We have previously recognized that the question raised by challenges to appellate counsel's approach in arguing an issue is whether an alternative tack \"would in any reasonable likelihood have achieved any different result from the appellate process.\" <i>Steinhorst v. Wainwright,</i> 477 So.2d 537, 541 (Fla.1985). A claim that an issue should have been presented differently is necessarily to some degree a variant of the previous argument, and should not be denied for that reason alone.</p>\n<p>Instead, I would deny relief because these claims are without merit. In the direct appeal, we agreed with counsel's argument that the trial court erred in excluding Hinton's prior inconsistent statements and in admitting the evidence of Reaves' attempt to sell cocaine in Georgia, but determined that these errors were harmless. <i>See </i><i>Reaves v. State,</i> 639 So.2d 1, 4, 5 (Fla.1994). Accordingly, I cannot conclude that Reaves' counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain reversal on these claims. Nor was counsel ineffective in the manner in which he argued the issue of the failure to find nonstatutory mitigators. \"While it is nearly always possible to envision a different approach to arguing an issue on appeal after a particular attempt has not been successful, such a speculation based on the benefit of hindsight does not establish ineffectiveness of counsel.\" <i>Steinhorst,</i> 477 So.2d at 541.</p>\n<p>Finally, I question whether disposition of this habeas petition is premature in light of the fact that we have remanded a portion of Reaves' rule 3.850 claim regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing. <i>See </i><i>Reaves v. State,</i> 826 So.2d 932, 944 (Fla.2002).</p>\n<p>ANSTEAD, C.J., concurs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The trial court found three aggravating circumstances: (1) Reaves was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person; (2) the capital felony was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody; and (3) the capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC). § 921.141(5)(b), (e), (h), Fla. Stat. (1985). On direct appeal, this Court held that HAC was not applicable, but the death penalty was still warranted.</p>\n<p>[2]  The trial court found that no statutory mitigation existed and three nonstatutory mitigating circumstances applied: (1) Reaves was honorably discharged from military service; (2) he had a good reputation in his community up to the age of sixteen; and (3) he was a considerate son to his mother and good to his siblings.</p>\n<p>[3]  Appellate counsel asserted that the trial court erred by (1) refusing to admit evidence of witness Hinton's prior inconsistent statements, (2) ruling erroneously on various jury selection issues, (3) excluding Dr. Weitz's testimony during the guilt phase, (4) denying Reaves' motion to disqualify the Office of the State Attorney, (5) denying Reaves' motions for mistrial based upon prosecutorial misconduct, (6) permitting the admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence of Reaves' attempted drug transaction in Georgia, (7) determining that the court had jurisdiction to try the case, (8) giving erroneous jury instructions relative to charges regarding first-degree murder, reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof, (9) admitting over objection various inflammatory pieces of evidence and permitting numerous deputies to remain in the courtroom during the proceedings, (10) denying Reaves' motion to dismiss the jury venire, (11) refusing to appoint co-counsel, (12) denying Reaves' motion to compel discovery, (13) finding that the crime was HAC, (14) failing to find two statutory mitigators applied in the case, and (15) failing to find numerous nonstatutory mitigation. Reaves also challenged the constitutionality of Florida's death penalty statute.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>See </i><i>Armstrong v. State,</i> 642 So.2d 730, 740 (Fla.1994) (holding that the failure to obtain ruling on a motion fails to preserve the issue for appeal).</p>\n<p>[5]  I agree that the argument on the exclusion of Dr. Weitz's guilt-phase testimony is merely a variant of the claim concerning \"Vietnam Syndrome\" evidence which we rejected in the direct appeal. <i>See </i><i>Reaves v.

Kern, Covington, for Defendant-Appellee Rodney Strain, Sheriff, St. Tammany Parish.</p>\n<p>Before: FOIL, FOGG, and KLINE,<sup>[1]</sup> JJ.</p>\n<p>FOGG, J.</p>\n<p>By this appeal, a prisoner seeking production of certain public records challenges the sustaining of the defendant's peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause and no right of action. For the following reasons, we vacate the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The record establishes that on July 27, 2001, Rodney Revere, an inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola, filed a public records request with the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. Mr. Revere sought the employment and disciplinary file of an employee of the Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office refused to provide the records, and Mr. Revere filed suit. The Sheriff's Office subsequently filed a peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause and no right of action.</p>\n<p>On December 10, 2001, a hearing was held before Judge Patricia T. Hedges. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge orally sustained the defendant's exception. However, on December 17, 2001, Judge Hedges signed an order recusing herself from this matter, \"[i]n order to avoid the appearance of any impropriety or bias.\"</p>\n<p>On December 19, 2001, Judge Hedges signed a judgment sustaining the defendant's exception and dismissing Mr. Revere's petition. From this judgment, Mr. Revere appeals.</p>\n<p>LSA-C.C.P. art. 152 provides that a judge may recuse herself in any cause in which a ground for recusation exists. Until a judge has recused herself, she has full power and authority to act in the cause. However, the power and authority for her to act as judge in a particular case for any and all reasons ceases at the moment of recusal. <i>See </i><i>Acadian Heritage Realty v. City of Lafayette,</i> 425 So.2d 388 (La.App. 3 Cir.1982). Our Supreme Court, in <i>State v. Price,</i> 274 So.2d 194, 197 (La.1973), stated,</p>\n<blockquote>It has long been recognized in our civil procedure that once a judge is recused, or a motion for his recusal has been filed, he has no power to act (except to appoint the proper person to sit ad hoc when the law provides for such an appointment). Any action taken by a recused judge is an absolute nullity. <i>State v. Judge of Twenty-First Judicial District,</i> 37 La.Ann. 253 (1885); <i>State v. Judge of Twenty-Second Judicial District Court,</i> 39 La.Ann. 994, 3 So. 91 (1887); <i>Jones v. Cunningham,</i> 157 La. 208, 102 So. 309 (1924); <i>State v. Savoy,</i> 207 La. 982, 22 So.2d 402 (1945).</blockquote>\n<p>After Judge Hedges' recusal in this matter, her power to act was limited and did not include the authority to sign a judgment. Therefore, we vacate the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings. Assessment of costs shall await final disposition of this matter.</p>\n<p>VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Retired Judge William F.

For the following reasons, we vacate the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>The record establishes that on July 27, 2001, Rodney Revere, an inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola, filed a public records request with the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. Mr. Revere sought the employment and disciplinary file of an employee of the Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office refused to provide the records, and Mr. Revere filed suit. The Sheriff's Office subsequently filed a peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause and no right of action.</p>\n<p>On December 10, 2001, a hearing was held before Judge Patricia T. Hedges. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial judge orally sustained the defendant's exception. However, on December 17, 2001, Judge Hedges signed an order recusing herself from this matter, \"[i]n order to avoid the appearance of any impropriety or bias.\"</p>\n<p>On December 19, 2001, Judge Hedges signed a judgment sustaining the defendant's exception and dismissing Mr. Revere's petition. From this judgment, Mr. Revere appeals.</p>\n<p>LSA-C.C.P. art. 152 provides that a judge may recuse herself in any cause in which a ground for recusation exists. Until a judge has recused herself, she has full power and authority to act in the cause. However, the power and authority for her to act as judge in a particular case for any and all reasons ceases at the moment of recusal. <i>See </i><i>Acadian Heritage Realty v.

We reverse for further proceedings on claims one through three.</p>\n<p>In 1997, a jury convicted McDuffy of aggravated battery. The victim in the case was a woman with whom McDuffy lived. McDuffy's first three claims in his rule 3.850 motion were related. However, the claims asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress because the police made a warrantless entry into the home without consent or exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p>The trial court denied all three claims finding they were refuted by the record. It attached the testimony of the victim, the victim's seven-year-old son, and two police officers to support the denial. The testimony showed that the victim was interviewed at the hospital by one officer. She claimed her injuries were the result of a falling accident in her home. Specifically, the victim told the officer that she fell through a glass coffee table. It shattered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*591</span> and caused her lacerations. She stated that she had called McDuffy to come stay with her son at home while another friend took her to the hospital.</p>\n<p>Skeptical of her story, the officer told the victim he was going to her home to see if the glass coffee table was broken. Two officers went to the home and knocked on the door. The victim's minor son opened the door and let the officers enter. McDuffy, apparently inebriated, was sleeping on the couch and could not be awakened for several minutes. One of the officers did a protective sweep of the entire home and saw a bloody knife on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>In McDuffy's case, nothing in the record attachments provided by the trial court shows that the victim actually and voluntarily consented to the officers' entry into her home without first obtaining a warrant or that the child could or did consent to entry into the home. <i>See </i><i>Saavedra v.

In the absence of exigent circumstances or permission, the police clearly may not enter a home without a search warrant simply because they think they have probable cause to believe evidence of a crime may be found therein. <i>See </i><i>Butler v. State,</i> 697 So.2d 907, 908 (Fla. 2d DCA 1997).

Loiselle, was employed as a maintenance engineer by Spokane Methodist Homes, Inc., d/b/a Rockwood Manor, a retirement home for elderly people. On October 25, 1967, he was injured when a furnace exploded. He filed a claim with the Department of Labor &amp; Industries. Although the supervisor denied the claim, the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals allowed the claim and was upheld on appeal to the superior court. The employer appeals.</p>\n<p>The employer assigns two errors: (1) the trial court erred in finding it was covered by the workmen's compensation act in the first instance in view of its being a charitable institution; and (2) the trial court erred in finding claimant entitled to benefits of the Industrial Insurance Act because at the time of injury he was employed in an \"apartment house\" within the meaning of RCW 51.12.010.</p>\n<p>With respect to the first contention, the record shows the employer was incorporated under RCW 24.08 covering educational, religious, benevolent, fraternal or charitable societies, now codified in RCWA 24.03; the United States Treasury Department recognized the employer as a charitable institution for federal income tax exemption purposes; the articles of incorporation clearly reflect the employer's charitable nature; and the testimony contained in the record before the department indicates the employer's operation was conducted in accordance with its charitable purposes and not for profit or pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p>In <i>Thurston County Chapter, American Nat'l Red Cross v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> 166 Wash. 488, 489-93, 7 P.2d 577 (1932), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote>The question is whether, under the facts stated, the Red Cross, a purely charitable organization and not operated for profit or pecuniary gain, is within the workmen's compensation act and should be required to pay industrial insurance and medical aid premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>... [B]efore a charitable or benevolent organization, not operated for profit or pecuniary gain, will be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> required to pay industrial insurance or medical aid premiums, it must come within the language of the act or within the plain import of the language used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The workmen's compensation act of this state makes no mention of benevolent or charitable organizations, and the whole theory of the act is to the effect that it applies to a trade or business which is operated for profit or pecuniary gain....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Had the legislature intended to bring within its provisions charitable organizations which were not liable for torts of its agents and servants except for failure to exercise reasonable care in their selection, it undoubtedly would have said so in plain terms; or from the language used it would be necessarily implied. We are of the opinion that it was not the legislative intent that charitable organizations, such as the Red Cross, engaged in work as above stated, should be within the operation of the act.</blockquote>\n<p>In 1945, the legislature amended the act to extend its benefits to employees of charitable and nonprofit institutions. Laws of 1945, ch. 89, at 243 (Rem. Supp. § 7692.1 (1945)). For technical reasons this amendment was declared unconstitutional in <i>Swedish Hosp. v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> 26 Wn.2d 819, 176 P.2d 429 (1947). No further attempt was made by the legislature to amend the act in this respect.</p>\n<p>[1, 2] The claimant contends that because the doctrine of charitable immunity has been abrogated in this state, <i>Friend v. Cove Methodist Church, Inc.,</i> 65 Wn.2d 174, 396 P.2d 546 (1964); <i>Pierce v. Yakima Valley Memorial Hosp. Ass'n,</i> 43 Wn.2d 162, 260 P.2d 765 (1953), charitable institutions are now within the coverage of the act. We disagree. Neither of these cases involved the workmen's compensation act or legislative intent. Only the legislature can change the legislative intent declared in <i>Thurston.</i> It has not seen fit to do so in spite of the fact that charitable immunity was partially abrogated as early as 1953 and completely abrogated in 1964. If charitable institutions are to be covered by the workmen's compensation act, it must be done by legislative enactment, and not by the courts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> In view of this holding it is unnecessary to consider the employer's second assignment of error.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p>MUNSON, C.J., and EVANS, J., concur.</p>\n<p>Petition for rehearing denied May 3, 1971.</p>\n<p>Review granted by Supreme Court June 22, 1971.</p>\n</div>",

The employer appeals.</p>\n<p>The employer assigns two errors: (1) the trial court erred in finding it was covered by the workmen's compensation act in the first instance in view of its being a charitable institution; and (2) the trial court erred in finding claimant entitled to benefits of the Industrial Insurance Act because at the time of injury he was employed in an \"apartment house\" within the meaning of RCW 51.12.010.</p>\n<p>With respect to the first contention, the record shows the employer was incorporated under RCW 24.08 covering educational, religious, benevolent, fraternal or charitable societies, now codified in RCWA 24.03; the United States Treasury Department recognized the employer as a charitable institution for federal income tax exemption purposes; the articles of incorporation clearly reflect the employer's charitable nature; and the testimony contained in the record before the department indicates the employer's operation was conducted in accordance with its charitable purposes and not for profit or pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p>In <i>Thurston County Chapter, American Nat'l Red Cross v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span>, 489-93, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></span> (1932), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote>The question is whether, under the facts stated, the Red Cross, a purely charitable organization and not operated for profit or pecuniary gain, is within the workmen's compensation act and should be required to pay industrial insurance and medical aid premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>... [B]efore a charitable or benevolent organization, not operated for profit or pecuniary gain, will be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*600</span> required to pay industrial insurance or medical aid premiums, it must come within the language of the act or within the plain import of the language used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The workmen's compensation act of this state makes no mention of benevolent or charitable organizations, and the whole theory of the act is to the effect that it applies to a trade or business which is operated for profit or pecuniary gain....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Had the legislature intended to bring within its provisions charitable organizations which were not liable for torts of its agents and servants except for failure to exercise reasonable care in their selection, it undoubtedly would have said so in plain terms; or from the language used it would be necessarily implied. We are of the opinion that it was not the legislative intent that charitable organizations, such as the Red Cross, engaged in work as above stated, should be within the operation of the act.</blockquote>\n<p>In 1945, the legislature amended the act to extend its benefits to employees of charitable and nonprofit institutions. Laws of 1945, ch. 89, at 243 (Rem. Supp. § 7692.1 (1945)). For technical reasons this amendment was declared unconstitutional in <i>Swedish Hosp. v. Department of Labor &amp; Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3999779\"><a href=\"/opinion/4223876/swedish-hospital-etc-v-dept-l-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3999779\"><a href=\"/opinion/4223876/swedish-hospital-etc-v-dept-l-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span> (1947). No further attempt was made by the legislature to amend the act in this respect.</p>\n<p>[1, 2] The claimant contends that because the doctrine of charitable immunity has been abrogated in this state, <i>Friend v.

We disagree. Neither of these cases involved the workmen's compensation act or legislative intent. Only the legislature can change the legislative intent declared in <i>Thurston.</i> It has not seen fit to do so in spite of the fact that charitable immunity was partially abrogated as early as 1953 and completely abrogated in 1964. If charitable institutions are to be covered by the workmen's compensation act, it must be done by legislative enactment, and not by the courts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*601</span> In view of this holding it is unnecessary to consider the employer's second assignment of error.</p>\n<p>Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p>MUNSON, C.J., and EVANS, J., concur.</p>\n<p>Petition for rehearing denied May 3, 1971.</p>\n<p>Review granted by Supreme Court June 22, 1971.</p>\n</div>",

Coenen, District Attorney, Penny Wise Douciere, Kenneth Douglas Wheeler, Assistant District Attorneys, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before STEWART, GASKINS and PEATROSS, JJ.</p>\n<p>STEWART, J.</p>\n<p>In this matter, the defendant, Danny Ray Jefferson, pled guilty to simple robbery and attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, with concurrent sentences of seven years and seven and one-half years on the respective counts. The defendant filed a <i>pro se</i> brief in which he asserts the illegality of his sentence based on the trial judge's failure to recuse himself and disputes the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction. The appointed appellate counsel seeks to withdraw representation based on a lack of appealable issues in this matter. We affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence and grant the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTS</h2>\n<p>On May 9, 2001, the defendant, while armed with a shotgun, took his mother's car keys and drove the car from her home. The police found the defendant a few miles away. The shotgun was inside the car. On June 1, 2001, the defendant was charged with armed robbery, to which he pled not guilty. The state later amended the bill of information to add a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon based on the defendant's prior conviction in 1993 of attempted possession of cocaine. The defendant pled not guilty to this charge as well.</p>\n<p>The defendant filed several <i>pro se</i> motions, including a motion to recuse the trial judge filed on January 8, 2002. As a basis for the recusal, the defendant alleged a conflict of interest based on a \"business and personal relationship\" between the trial judge and the district attorney. The defendant's motion referred to a pending legal matter in federal court against the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*735</span> Richland Parish district attorney and sheriff's department.</p>\n<p>On January 14, 2002, the defendant, who was represented by counsel, entered into a written plea agreement with the state. The defendant agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges of simple robbery and attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The defendant and the state also agreed to a seven year hard labor sentence on the simple robbery charge and a seven and one-half year sentence on the attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon charge, with the sentences to run concurrent. During the guilty plea proceedings, the defendant further agreed to dismiss his motion to recuse the trial judge. The record reflects that prior to accepting the plea agreement, the trial judge fully advised the defendant of his constitutional rights and determined that the defendant understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p>On April 10, 2002, the trial court sentenced the defendant pursuant to the terms of the written plea agreement. Thereafter, the defendant again filed a motion to recuse. Two trial judges subsequently recused themselves from further proceedings involving the defendant. The defendant also filed post-sentencing motions to dismiss the charges and correct the illegal sentence based on the argument that the trial judge erred in failing to recuse himself at the time of the motion to recuse filed in January 2001, prior to the plea agreement. These were denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the defendant's appointed counsel filed a brief and motion pursuant to <i>State v. Jyles,</i> 96-2669 (La.12/12/97), 704 So.2d 241, in which he asserted that he could find no appealable issues. Counsel moved to be allowed to withdraw as the defendant's counsel of record.</p>\n<p>On July 31, 2002, this court issued an order holding the motion in abeyance and granting the defendant thirty days in which to file any briefs. The defendant timely filed a brief, but he failed to provide any assignments of error. Instead, the defendant reasserted his arguments that the plea agreement and sentence are illegal due to the failure of the trial judge to recuse himself and that the evidence of the robbery was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>The record shows the bills of information to be in proper form. The defendant was represented by counsel. In accepting the defendant's guilty plea, the trial court complied with La.C.Cr.P. art. 556.1. At the guilty plea proceeding, the trial judge advised the defendant of the right to trial by jury, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him, the presumption of innocence, the right to remain silent, and the right to court-appointed counsel. The defendant knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to the significantly reduced charges of simple robbery and attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The defendant and the state agreed to concurrent sentences of seven years and seven and one-half years respectively. These sentences were within the statutory limits of La. R.S. 14:65, and one-half the statutory limit of La. R.S. 14:95.1, as required by the attempt statute, La. R.S. 14:27.</p>\n<p>With regard to the defendant's motion to recuse filed prior to the plea agreement, the record clearly reflects that the defendant dismissed the recusal motion prior to entering his guilty plea. The record also reflects that the trial judge questioned the defendant about his understanding that he was dismissing the recusal motion along with entering the guilty plea. Again, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*736</span> defendant knowingly agreed to dismiss the motion to recuse. We find no merit to the claim that the sentence was illegal due to the failure of the trial judge to recuse himself.</p>\n<p>We also find no merit to the defendant's claim that the state's evidence does not support his conviction and that his actions were not robbery. A validly entered plea, or a plea of <i>nolo contendere,</i> waives any right a defendant might have had to question the merits of the state's case and the factual basis underlying the conviction. <i>State v. Bourgeois,</i> 406 So.2d 550 (La.1981); <i>State v. Harden,</i> 506 So.2d 1265 (La.App. 2d Cir.1987), <i>writ denied,</i> 512 So.2d 438 (La.1987). Because the defendant entered an <i>Alford</i> plea of guilty to the charge of simple robbery, he cannot now challenge the merits of the state's case or the factual basis underlying his conviction.</p>\n<p>An examination of the sentencing transcript shows that the trial judge carefully reviewed every factor listed in La. C.Cr.P. art. 894.1. Moreover, because the defendant agreed to a specific sentence as a consequence of his plea bargain, the sentence cannot be appealed as excessive. La.C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2); <i>State v. Henton,</i> 35,363 (La.App.2d Cir.12/19/01), 803 So.2d 405.</p>\n<p>Our review of this record discloses no error patent. The defendant was advised of his rights to appeal and to seek post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the guilty plea was properly obtained. The sentence imposed is lawful and within the terms of the written plea agreement. The defendant voluntarily dismissed his motion to recuse the trial judge before entering the guilty plea. There is no showing of any abuse of the trial court's broad discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DECREE</h2>\n<p>We hereby affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.
