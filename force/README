Instructions:

  Modifed from the example at of D3
  http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html

  Run the file force.py to generate the force.json data file needed for this to work.

  Then copy all of the files in this directory to a webserver and load force.html.
  
 Functionality:
 
  This project focuses on producing a contacts network for a given investment advisor or broker. Contacts are "closer" to the 
  given advisor given by how much time they have spent working with the advisor at any company the advisor has worked at.
  A heatmap for how "corrupt" a given conneciton is (supposed) to be determined by how many times this contact has been mentioned
  in a corpus of filtered financial fraud related court cases. We could not fully get this fucntinoality to display on the graph but
  the code is almost working and attached. 
  
  In terms of actual output, we were able to generate a simple contacts network for a given person. A front end searchable database
  has also been created, though the search function doesnt quite work yet (not integrated with out python code).
